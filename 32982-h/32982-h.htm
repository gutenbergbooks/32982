<h1><a name="Introduction"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h1>


<p>In the year 1876, as Microscopist of the Department of Agriculture, I
prepared, as a part of the exhibit of my Division at the Centennial Exhibition
at Philadelphia, a large collection of water-color drawings representing
leading types of the edible and poisonous mushrooms of the
United States, together with representations of about nine hundred species
of microscopic fungi detrimental to vegetation.</p>

<p>In the preparation of the first collection I had the valuable assistance
of Prof. Charles H. Peck, State Botanist of New York, and in the second
the hearty co-operation of Rev. M. J. Berkeley and Dr. M. C. Cook, the
eminent British mycologists.</p>

<p>The popular character of this exhibit attracted the attention of the
general public, and many letters were received at the Department showing
an awakening interest in the study of fungi, particularly with regard
to the mushroom family, as to methods of cultivation, the means of determining
the good from the unwholesome varieties, etc.</p>

<p>My first published paper on the subject of edible mushrooms, entitled
"Twelve Edible Mushrooms of the U. S.," appeared in the annual report
of the Department of Agriculture for 1885. This was followed by others
to the number of five, and as the demand for these reports increased,
reprints were made and issued, by order of the Secretary of Agriculture,
in pamphlet form, under the general title of "Food Products." Numerous
editions of these reprints were issued by the Department up to 1894.
During the year 1894, and the first half of 1895, 36,600 of these reports
were sent out by the Department, and the supply was exhausted. They
have been out of print for more than two years. It is in view of this fact,
and in response to a great and constant demand for these publications,
that I have undertaken to publish a series of five pamphlets on the edible
and poisonous mushrooms of the United States, which shall embody the
substance of the five pamphlets on "Food Products" above alluded to,
supplemented by new matter relating to classification, general and specific,
analytical tables of standard authors, and a continuation of the chapters
on structure, etc. Additional plates, representing leading types of edible
and poisonous mushrooms, will also be inserted in each number.</p>

<p>In the compilation and extension of this work I have the assistance
of my daughter, Miss A. Robena Taylor, who has given considerable
attention to the study of fungi, and who has been my faithful coadjutor
in the work of collecting specimens, etc., for a number of years.</p>

<p>For valuable suggestions as to structural characteristics and methods
of classification I am especially indebted to Prof. Chas. H. Peck, of
Albany, New York, Dr. M. C. Cooke, of England, and Prof. P. A.
Saccardo, of Italy.</p>

<p>The colored plates in pamphlet No. 1, together with a few of those which
will appear in the succeeding numbers of this series, are reproductions of
those prepared, under my direct supervision, for the pamphlets entitled
"Food Products" published by the Department of Agriculture and referred
to above.</p>

<h1><a name="Cryptogams"></a>CRYPTOGAMS.</h1>


<p>The cryptogamic or flowerless plants, <i>i. e.</i>, those having neither stamens
nor pistils, and which are propagated by spores, are divided, according to
Dr. Hooper, into the following four classes:&mdash;Pteridophyta or vascular
acrogens, represented by the ferns, club-mosses, etc.; Bryophyta or cellular
acrogens, represented by the musci, scale-mosses, etc.; Algæ, represented
by the "Red Seaweeds," Diatomacæ, etc.; Fungi or Amphigens,
which include the molds, mildews, mushrooms, etc. The lichens, according
to the "Schwendener Hypotheses," consist of ascigerous fungi parasitic
on algæ.</p>


<h2><a name="Fungi"></a>FUNGI.</h2>

<p>Botanists unite in describing the plants of this class as being destitute
of chlorophyll and of starch. These plants assume an infinite variety of
forms, and are propagated by spores which are individually so minute as
to be scarcely perceptible to the naked eye. They are entirely cellular,
and belong to the class Amphigens, which for the most part have no determinate
axe, and develop in every direction, in contradistinction to the
Acrogens, which develop from the summit, possessing an axe, leaves, vessels,
etc.</p>

<p>Fungi are divided by systematists into two great classes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sporifera, in which the spores are free, naked, or soon exposed.</li>

<li>Sporidifera, in which the spores are not exposed, but instead are enclosed
in minute cells or sacs, called asci.</li>
</ol>

<p>These classes are again subdivided, according to the disposition of the
spores and of the spore bearing surface, called the hymenium, into various
families.</p>

<p>The sporiferous fungi are arranged into four families, viz:</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Hymenomycetes</i>, in which the hymenium is free, mostly naked, or
soon exposed. <i>Example, "Common Meadow Mushroom."</i></li>

<li><i>Gasteromycetes</i>, in which the hymenium is enclosed in a second case
or wrapper, called a peridium, which ruptures when mature, thus releasing
the spores. <i>Example, Common Puff Ball.</i></li>

<li><i>Coniomycetes</i>, in which the spores are naked, mostly terminal on inconspicuous
threads, free or enclosed in a perithecium. Dust-like fungi.
<i>Example, Rust of Wheat.</i></li>

<li><i>Hyphomycetes</i>, in which the spores are naked on conspicuous
threads, rarely compacted, Thread-like fungi. <i>Example, Blue Mold.</i></li>
</ol>

<p>Of these four subdivisions of the Sporifera, only the Hymenomycetes
and the Gasteromycetes contain plants of the mushroom family, and these
two together constitute the class known as the Basidiomycetes. The
chief distinction of the Basidiomycetes is that the naked spores are borne
on the summits of certain supporting bodies, termed basidia. These
basides are swollen, club-shaped cells, surmounted by four minute tubes
or spore-bearers, called sterigmata, each of which carries a spore. See
Figs. 3 and 4, <a href="#PLATE_A">Plate A</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1-5" id="Page_1-5">[Pg 1-5]</a></span></p><p>These basides together with a series of elongated cells, termed paraphyses,
packed closely together side by side, and intermixed with other
sterile cells, called cystidia, constitute the spore-bearing surface or
hymenium of the plant.</p>

<p>To the naked eye this hymenium appears simply as a very thin smooth
membrane, but when a small portion of it is viewed through a microscope
with high powers its complex structure is readily observed and can be
carefully studied.</p>

<p>The <i>Sporidiferous</i> fungi are represented by the families Physomycetes
and Ascomycetes. The first of these consists wholly of microscopic
fungi.</p>

<p><i>Ascomycetes.</i>&mdash;In the plants of this family the spores are not supported
upon basidia, but instead are enclosed in minute sacs or asci
formed from the fertile cells of a hymenium. In this connection it would
be well to state that Saccardo does not recognize the divisions <i>Sporifera</i>
and <i>Sporidifera</i> by those names.</p>

<p>They are nearly the equivalent of Basidiomycetes and Ascomycetes.</p>

<p>What Cooke names Physomycetes, Saccardo calls Phycomyceteæ, introducing
it in his work between Gasteromyceteæ and Myxomyceteæ, which
some mycologists consider somewhat out of place.</p>

<p>Saccardo calls its asci (sacs which contain the spores) sporangia. He
does not regard them as genuine asci, but as corresponding more to the
peridium of the <i>Gasteromyceteæ</i> and <i>Myxomyceteæ.</i></p>

<p>Peck says that this group seems to present characters of both Hyphomycetes
and Ascomycetes, with a preponderance towards Hyphomycetes.</p>

<p>It is a small group, however, and since it consists wholly of microscopic
fungi, need not be farther considered in this work.</p>

<p>In the Ascomycetes are included the sub-families Discomycetes, Pyrenomycetes,
and Tuberacei. Of these the Discomycetes and the Tuberacei
are the only groups which contain any of the mushrooms, and but
few of these are large enough or sufficiently tender to possess value as
esculents. A good example of the first (Discomycetes) is found in the
Morel, and of the second (Tuberacei) in the Truffle.</p>

<p>In the Discomycetes or "disk fungi," the spores are produced in minute
membraneous sacs, each sac usually containing eight spores. These
spore sacs are imbedded in the flesh of the exterior and upper surface of
the mushroom cap.</p>

<p>In the four classes, Hymenomycetes, Gasteromycetes, Discomycetes,
and Tuberacei, therefore, are included all of the plants which are here
designated under the generic term of "mushrooms."</p>

<p>Some idea of the relative numerical value of these classes may be obtained
from the following figures given by the distinguished British mycologist,
M. C. Cooke:</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">

</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1-6" id="Page_1-6">[Pg 1-6]</a></span></p><p>(The Tuberacei comprise a very small group of subterranean fungi, and
comparatively few of the species are described.)</p>

<p>Saccardo in his Sylloge gives a total of 42,000 described species of
fungi of all classes, including the most minute. Of these the Hymenomycetes
include by far the largest number of edible mushrooms.</p>

<p>The family Hymenomycetes is divided into the following six orders:
Agaricini, Polyporei, Hydnei, Thelephorei, Clavarei, Tremellini.</p>

<p>In the order Agaricini the hymenium is found on the under surface of
the mushroom cap, covering pleats or gills, technically called lamellæ.
These gills vary in character in the different genera, being "persistent in
such as the Agaricus, Russula, and Lentinus, deliquescent (melting) in
Coprinus, Bolbitius, etc. The edge of the gills is acute in Agaricus, Marasmius,
etc., but obtuse and vein-like in Cantharellus, longitudinally
channelled in Trogia, and splitting in Schyzophyllum."</p>

<p>In the Polyporei, pore-bearing mushrooms, the gills are replaced by
tubes or pores. The tubes are little cylinders, long or short, pressed one
against another, forming by their union a layer on the under surface of
the cap, and the sporiferous membrane or hymenium lines their inner
walls. Their upper end is always closed, while the lower extremity is
open to permit the outward passage of the spores. The tubes are generally
joined together and are not easily disunited. They are free, <i>i. e.</i>,
separable, in the sole genus <i>Fistulina</i>. As regards their attachment to
the cap, the tubes may be firmly adherent as in the genus Polyporus or
easily detached in a single mass as in Boletus, the fleshy form of the order
Polyporei. They frequently leave a circular space of greater or less dimensions
around the stem, or they adhere to or are prolonged upon it in
such a manner that the orifices rise in tiers one above another. The
color of the tubes, although not offering as characteristic varieties as
that of the gills, changes nevertheless according to species and according
to the age of the plant. The tubes may sometimes be of a different color
from their orifices, as in <i>Boletus luridus</i>. In some of the Boleti the color
of the flesh is changed on exposure to the air and the tubes often assume
the same tints. The tubes, generally called pores, are sometimes closely
adherent to the substance of the cap, which is often hard, corky, or coriaceous,
as seen in most of the <i>Polyporei</i>.</p>

<p>In the Hydnei, spine-bearing mushrooms, the hymenium is seen covering
the spines or needle-like processes which take the place of gills in this
order, and which project from the under surface of the cap. These
spines may be divided or entire, simple or ramified, and are formed of the
substance of the cap. In the early stages of development they appear
like small projecting points or papillæ, those on the margin of the cap
and at the apex of the stem being always less developed, frequently remaining
in this rudimentary state. They are rounded in the species
Hydnum imbricatum, sometimes compressed in Hydnum repandum, sometimes
terminating in hairs or filaments, as in Hydnum barba Jovis, or very
much divided, as in Hydnum fimbriatum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1-7" id="Page_1-7">[Pg 1-7]</a></span></p><p>In the Clavarei, the whole plant consists of solid fleshy masses without
any stem of a distinct substance, sometimes club-shaped, sometimes
branched with the hymenium smoothly covering the entire surface, never
incrusting or coriaceous.</p>

<p>In the Thelephorei, the lower surface of the cap presents neither gills,
pores, nor spines, but instead the hymenium covers an uneven or slightly
wrinkled surface, partially striate, sometimes obscurely papillose. The
plants of this order assume a great variety of shape, from that of a perfect
cup with a central stem to an irregularly and much branched frond.
They are generally dry and tough. Very few are recommended as edible.
Prof. Peck says of this order that probably no edible species will be found
in any of its genera outside of the genus Craterellus.</p>

<p>In the order Tremellini we have a great departure from the character
of the substance, external appearance, and internal structure of the other
orders of the Hymenomycetes. The substance is gelatinous; the form
is lobed, folded, or convolute, often resembling the brain of some animal.
It is uniformly composed throughout of a colorless mucilage, with no appreciable
texture, in which are distributed very fine, diversely branched,
and anastomosing filaments. Towards the surface the ultimate branches
of this filamentous network give birth to globular cells, both at their
summits and laterally, which attain a comparatively large size. These
cells are filled with a protoplasm, to which the plant owes its color. The
fertile threads are not compacted into a true hymenium.</p>

<p>Representative types of the above-described orders of the Hymenomycetes
are shown in <a href="#PLATE_B">Plate B</a>. The various genera, and species of these
orders, will be described more in detail in connection with the species
illustrated.</p>

<h1><a name="Classification"></a>CLASSIFICATION.</h1>


<p>Owing to the fact that botanists of various countries, writing in diverse
languages, have for more than a century been engaged in describing the
fungi of their respective countries, with their work frequently unknown
to one another, it is not surprising that there has been constant revision,
or that many changes have been made in the way of classification and
nomenclature which to the amateur student are often confusing.</p>

<p>The classification by the pioneer mycologist, Elias Fries, as presented
in his several works on fungi, ignored all microscopical characters, and
Saccardo's classification, as presented in his <i>Sylloge Fungorum</i>, was the
first complete system offered in its place.</p>

<p>Saccardo, in 1882, commenced his Sylloge, of which not less than
twelve volumes have been published. In Saccardo's system of classification
the six orders of the Hymenomycetes are not essentially different
in their arrangement from that of Fries, although Saccardo has
raised all the subgenera of Agaricus to the rank of genera, and then
altered their sequence so as to bring them into four sections, distinguished
by the color of their spores. Having raised the old subgenera of Fries
to generic rank, Saccardo found it necessary to limit the application of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1-8" id="Page_1-8">[Pg 1-8]</a></span>the term Agaricus to the group of fungi to which it was originally applied
by Linnæus, viz., the common field mushroom Agaricus campester,
and its allies, represented by Agaricus arvensis, Agaricus Rodmani, etc.,
or, as Prof. Peck more definitely states it, "to those of the gilled mushrooms
which have brown spores, free gills, a stem bearing a ring, gills
generally pink-colored in the early stage, and brownish black when fully
matured." M. C. Cooke, the distinguished English mycologist, prefers
to retain the <i>genus Agaricus</i> with its original subgenera intact, succeeded
by the other genera of Agaricini, as in the Hymenomycetes Europei of
Fries, giving as his reason the belief "that for purposes of classification
features should be taken which are present and evident in the specimens
themselves, and are not dependent on any of their life-history which cannot
be presented in the herbarium."</p>

<p>In a work such as the present, which is designed to be popular in character
rather than purely technical, it is deemed advisable to select as a
basis for classification that system which is most accessible to reference
by the general reading public. Saccardo's Sylloge, while exhaustive in
character and of inestimable value to the mycologist, is written in Latin,
and is, moreover, a very expensive work&mdash;facts which render it practically
unavailable to the general public.</p>

<p>In the compilation of this series of pamphlets I have adopted the classification
of M. C. Cooke, which, as regards the Hymenomycetes, the family
containing most of the fleshy fungi, is, with exceptions noted, in accord
with that of Saccardo. M. C. Cooke's hand-book of fungi is of convenient
size and form for ready reference.</p>

<p>For the convenience, however, of those who may wish to familiarize
themselves with both systems, a synopsis of <i>Saccardo's Genera</i> of Hymenomycetes
will be given later.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h1><a name="Structure"></a>STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE AGARICINI.</h1>


<p>By far the greater number of the Agaricini have both cap and stem.
The form of the cap, as well as that of the stem, varies somewhat in the
different genera and species. Those which are terrestrial in habit are
generally of an umbrella-like shape, while those which grow upon trees
and decayed tree-stumps are apt to be one-sided or semi-spherical.</p>

<p>In many of the parasitical mushrooms the stem is absent. Where the
stem is present it is either an interrupted continuation of the hymenophore
or fleshy substance of the cap, or else is supported separately as
a pillar on which the cap rests, a more or less distinct line of demarcation
showing where the fibers terminate. Sometimes it is quite easily detached
from the cap socket, as in the Lepiota procerus. It may be hollow
or stuffed, solid or fibrillose. It varies in length and thickness. In some
species it is smooth and polished, in others rough and hairy, reticulated,
etc., sometimes tapering, sometimes distinctly bulbous at the base.</p>

<p>The spores of the species differ in color and are usually globular or oblong
in shape. All of these characteristics assist in determining the
species.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1-9" id="Page_1-9">[Pg 1-9]</a></span></p><h2><a name="Gills"></a>MUSHROOM GILLS.</h2>

<p>Mushroom gills, or lamellæ, anatomically considered, are composed,
first, of a central portion, a prolongation of the hymenophore or flesh of
the cap, more or less dense, sometimes so thin as to be scarcely perceptible;
second, the hymenium or spore-bearing membrane covering the
surfaces of this prolonged hymenophore. They are vertical, simple,
equal, respectively, or more frequently alternating with shorter gills.
They are often evanescent and putrescent, sometimes liquefying altogether.
Their color is usually different from the upper surface of the
cap, not always similar to that of the spores borne upon them, at least in
youth; with age, however, they usually assume the color of the mature
spore. The change of color of the gills according to the age of the plant
is very important in the study of the Agaricini; it accounts for the white
gills of certain species in youth, the pink in maturity, and the brown
when aged.</p>

<p>The end of the gill nearest the stalk of the plant is termed the posterior
extremity; the opposite end, the anterior extremity. In most of
the Agaricini the gills are unequal. Some extend from the margin to
about half the space between it and the stem; others are still shorter.</p>


<h2><a name="Volva"></a>THE VOLVA.</h2>

<p>The volva is a membrane which envelops the entire plant in embryo,
giving it the appearance of an egg. It originates at the base of the
mushroom and furnishes it, during its f&oelig;tal life, with the means of support
and nourishment. Its texture is so delicate that it generally disappears,
leaving very little trace of its existence on the adult plant. In
many of the volvate species this organ exists only so long as they are
under ground, and some mycologists restrict the term "volvati" to such
only as retain it afterwards. As the young plant expands it breaks
through the top of this volva or wrapper, and, emerging, carries with it
patches of the membrane on the upper surface of the cap. These are
more or less prominent, numerous, and thick, sometimes irregularly disposed,
sometimes regularly in the form of plates, warts, etc. At the base
of the stem of the mushroom the remains of the volva are seen in the
form of a sort of wrapper. This is more or less ample, thick, and ascending.
It is called <i>free</i> when it is loose or easily detached from the stem,
and <i>congenital</i> when it cannot be separated from it without laceration.
In some species it is distinctly membranous, and in others floccose, and
friable in character, sometimes appearing in ridges as a mere border, at
others broken up into scales, and, as the plant matures, wholly disappearing.
The volva is a feature of great importance in the study of the
Agaricini, of the subgenera Amanita, Volvaria, etc.</p>


<h2><a name="Veil"></a>THE MUSHROOM VEIL.</h2>

<p>The veil is not a constant feature in the Agaricini, at least it is not
always visible. When present it consists of a membrane which extends
from the margin of the cap to the stem, veiling or protecting the gills.
This membrane, called the cortina, has given its name to a numerous and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1-10" id="Page_1-10">[Pg 1-10]</a></span>important class of mushrooms (the <i>Cortinarias</i>). It is generally white,
soft, slightly spongy, cottony, at times fibrillose or even slightly fibrous,
again in texture comparable to the spider's web, and may be even
powdery or glutinous. It exists intact only in the youth of the plant.
It is not visible in the developing mushroom, at least while the cap is
closely pressed against the stem, but as the cap expands the membrane
extends and finally breaks, leaving in some species its remnants upon the
margin of the cap and upon the stem in the usual form of a ring or a mere
zone. When the stem is not ringed the veil rises high upon the stalk,
stretches across to meet the edges of the cap, and is afterwards reflected
back over its whole surface.</p>


<h2><a name="Spores"></a>MUSHROOM SPORES AND MYCELIUM.</h2>

<p>The spore is the reproductive organ of the mushroom. It differs from
the seed of the flowering plant in being destitute of an apparent embryo.
A seed contains a plantlet which develops as such. A spore is a minute
cell containing a nucleus or living germ, the reproductive cell germ called
by some authors the germinating granule. This in turn throws out a
highly elongated process consisting of a series of thread-like cells branching
longitudinally and laterally, at length bifurcating and anastomosing
the mass, forming the vegetative process known as mycelium or mushroom
spawn.</p>

<p>On this mycelium, at intervals, appear knob-like bodies, called tubercles,
from which the mushrooms spring and from which they derive their
nourishment. See Fig. 5, <a href="#PLATE_A">Plate A</a>.</p>

<p>Where the conditions have been unfavorable this mycelium has been
known to grow for years without bearing fruit.</p>

<p>Mushroom spores are very variable in size, shape, and color, but are
generally constant at maturity in the same genus. Their shape, almost
always spherical in the young plant, becomes ovate, ellipsoidal, fusiform,
reniform, smooth, stellate, sometimes tuberculate, or remains globose.
This feature, varying thus with the age of the plant, should be studied
in the mature plant.</p>


<h2><a name="Mycelium"></a>MYCELIUM.</h2>

<p>De Leveille has thus defined mycelium: "Filaments at first simple,
then more or less complicated, resulting from the vegetation of the spores
and serving as roots to the mushroom."</p>

<p>The mycelium of mushrooms or the mushroom spawn is usually white,
but is also found yellow, and even red. It is distinguished by some
writers as nematoid, fibrous, hymenoid, scleroid or tuberculous, and
malacoid. The nematoid mycelium is the most common. Creeping
along on the surface of the earth, penetrating it to a greater or less
depth, developing in manure among the débris of leaves or decayed
branches, always protected from the light, it presently consists of very
delicate filamentous cells more or less loosely interwoven, divided, anastomosing
in every direction and often of considerable extent.</p>

<p>Its presence is sometimes difficult to detect without the use of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1-11" id="Page_1-11">[Pg 1-11]</a></span>microscope, either on account of its delicacy or because of its being intermingled
with the organic tissues in which it has developed.</p>

<p>Sometimes mycelium unites in bundles more or less thick and branched.
This has been called the fibrous mycelium. Where the filaments intercross
closely, are felted, and inclined to form a membrane, it is hymenoid
mycelium. Where the filaments are so small and close that they form
very compact bodies, constituting those solid irregular products called
sclerotium, it is scleroid or tuberculous mycelium. With malacoid mycelium
we have nothing to do in this paper. It is a soft, pulpy, fleshy
mycelium.</p>

<p>Systematists have divided the Agaricini into groups according to the
color of their spores. These groups are defined as follows by various
authors:</p>

<blockquote><p>According to&mdash;</p>

<p>Elias Fries, 5 groups: <i>Leucosporus</i>, white; <i>Hyporhodius</i>, pink; <i>Cortinaria</i>, ochraceous;
<i>Derminus</i>, rust; <i>Pratella</i>, purplish black.</p>

<p>Rev. J. M. Berkeley, 5 groups: Very frequently pure white, but presenting also
pink, various tints of brown, from yellowish and rufous to dark bister, purple-black,
and finally black; <i>Leucospori</i>, white; <i>Hyporhodii</i>, salmon; <i>Dermini</i>, ferruginous;
<i>Pratellæ</i>, brown; <i>Coprinarius</i>, black.</p>

<p>Dr. Badham, 6 groups: Pure white or a yellow tinge on drying; brown; yellow;
pink; purple; purple-black; some pass successively from pink to purple and from
purple to purple-black.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hussey, 11 shades: White; rose; pale ocher; olivaceous-ocher; reddish-ocher;
ochraceous; yellowish olive-green; dull brown; scarcely ferruginous; snuff-color;
very dark brown.</p>

<p>Hogg &amp; Johnson, 5 groups: <i>Leucosporei</i>, white; <i>Hyporhodii</i>, salmon; <i>Dermini</i>,
rusty; <i>Pratellæ</i>, purplish-brown; <i>Coprinarii</i>, black.</p>

<p>C. Gillet, 7 shades: White; pink; ochraceous; yellow; ferruginous; black or purplish
black; round, ovate, elongated, or fusiform, smooth, tuberculate or irregular,
simple or composite, transparent or nebulous, etc.</p>

<p>Jules Bel, 5 groups: White; pink; red; brown; black.</p>

<p>Dr. Gautier, 5 shades: White; pink; brown; purplish-brown; black.</p>

<p>Constantin &amp; Dufour, 5 groups: White; pink; ochraceous; brownish-purple;
black.</p>

<p>J. P. Barla, 7 groups: <i>Leucosporii</i>, white; <i>Hyporhodii</i>, pink; <i>Cortinariæ</i>, ochraceous;
<i>Dermini</i>, rust; <i>Pratellæ</i>, purplish-black; <i>Coprinarii</i>, blackish; <i>Coprini</i> and
<i>Gomphi</i>, dense black.</p>

<p>L. Boyer, 5 groups, 11 shades: White to cream yellow; pale pink to ochraceous
yellow; bay or red brown to brown or blackish bister; rust color, cinnamon or light
yellow.</p>

<p>W. D. Hay, 5 groups: White; pink; brown; purple; black.</p>

<p>C. H. Peck, 5 groups: <i>Leucosporii</i>, white; <i>Hyporhodii</i>, salmon; <i>Dermini</i>, rust;
<i>Pratellæ</i>, brown; <i>Coprinarii</i>, black.</p>

<p>Saccardo divides the Agaricini into four sections, according to the color of their
spores, as follows: Spores brown, purplish brown or black, <i>Melanosporæ</i>; spores
ochraceous or rusty ochraceous, <i>Ochrosporæ</i>; spores rosy or pinkish, <i>Rhodosporæ</i>;
spores white, whitish or pale yellow, <i>Leucosporæ</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. M. C. Cooke, 5 groups: <i>Leucospori</i>, white or yellowish; <i>Hyporhodii</i>, rosy or
salmon color; <i>Dermini</i>, brown, sometimes reddish or yellowish brown; <i>Pratellæ</i>,
purple, sometimes brownish purple, dark purple, or dark brown; <i>Coprinarii</i>, black or
nearly so.</p></blockquote>

<p>These shades are somewhat different from the colors of the mushrooms'
gills, so that, when it is of importance to determine exactly the color of
the spore in the identification of a species, we may without recourse to
the microscope cut off the stem of an adult plant on a level with the gills
and place the under surface of the cap upon a leaf of white paper if a
dark-spored species, and upon a sheet of black paper if the spores are
light. At the expiration of a few hours we will find, on lifting the cap,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1-12" id="Page_1-12">[Pg 1-12]</a></span>a bed of the shed spores which will represent their exact shade. These
may be removed to a glass slide and their size and form determined by
means of the microscope.</p>

<p>In the present work Dr. M. C. Cooke's grouping of the spore series is
adopted.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h1><a name="Etymology"></a>ETYMOLOGY OF THE WORD "MUSHROOM."</h1>


<p>Various opinions have been offered as to the derivation of the word
"mushroom." According to Hay, it probably had its origin in a combination
of the two Welsh words <i>maes</i>, a field, and <i>rhum</i>, a knob, which by
gradual corruption have become <i>mushroom</i>. Some writers on the other
hand regard it as a corruption of <i>mousseron</i>, a name specifically applied
by the French to those mushrooms which are found growing in mossy
places. But it seems to be of older usage than such a derivation would
imply, and therefore the first explanation seems the more likely to be
correct.</p>

<p>In England the term "mushroom" has been most commonly applied to
the "meadow mushroom," that being the one best known; but English-speaking
mycologists now apply it generically very much as the French
do the term "champignon," while the name "champignon" is restricted
in England to the Marasmius oreades, or "Fairy Ring" mushroom.</p>

<p>Berkeley says the French word "champignon" was originally scarcely
of wider signification than our word "mushroom," though now classical in
the sense of fleshy fungi generally. The German word <i>Pilz</i> (a corruption
of Boletus) is used to denote the softer kinds by some German authors.
Constant and Dufour, in their recently published Atlas des Champignons,
include types of a great variety of mushrooms.</p>

<p>Hay contends that the pernicious nick-name "toad-stool" has not the
derivation supposed, but that the first part of the word is the Saxon or
old English "tod," meaning a bunch, cluster, or bush, the form of many
terrestrial fungi suggesting it. The second syllable, "stool," is easily supplied.
"The erroneous idea of connecting toads with these plants," says
Hay, "seems to be due to Spenser, or to some poet, possibly, before his
time." Spenser speaks of the loathed paddocks, "paddock" then being the
name given in England to the frog, afterwards corrupted to "paddic,"
and once received, readily converted by the Scotch into "puddick-stool." It
would seem, therefore, from the foregoing, that the term "toad-stool"
can have no proper relation to mushrooms, whether edible or poisonous.</p>

<p>The three mushrooms illustrated and described in this pamphlet, <a href="#PLATE_I">Plates
I</a>, <a href="#PLATE_II">II</a>, and <a href="#PLATE_III">III</a>, are of the order Agaricini or gilled mushrooms. They are
well-defined types and of wide geographical distribution.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h1><a name="Food"></a>FOOD VALUE OF MUSHROOMS.</h1>


<p>Rollrausch and Siegel, who claim to have made exhaustive investigations
into the food values of mushrooms, state that "many species
deserve to be placed beside meat as sources of nitrogenous nutriment,"
and their analysis, if correct, fully bears out the statement. They find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1-13" id="Page_1-13">[Pg 1-13]</a></span>in 100 parts of dried <i>Morchella esculenta</i> 35.18 per cent. of protein; in
<i>Helvella esculenta</i>, 26.31 per cent. of protein, from 46 to 49 per cent. of
potassium salts and phosphoric acid, 2.3 per cent. of fatty matter, and a
considerable quantity of sugar. The <i>Boletus edulis</i> they represent as
containing in 100 parts of the dried substance 22.82 per cent. of protein.
The nitrogenous values of different foods as compared with the mushroom
are stated as follows: "Protein substances calculated for 100 parts
of bread, 8.03; of oatmeal, 9.74; of barley bread, 6.39; of leguminous
fruits, 27.05; of potatoes, 4.85; of mushrooms, 33.0."</p>

<p>According to Schlossberger and Depping, in 100 grams of dried mushrooms
they found the following proportions of nitrogenous substances:</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><th align="center">Varieties.</th><th align="right">Grains.</th></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Chanterelles</td><td align="right">3.22</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Certain Russulas</td><td align="right">4.25</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Lactarius deliciosus</td><td align="right">4.68</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Boletus edulis</td><td align="right">4.25</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Meadow mushroom</td><td align="right">7.26</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>But all chemists are not agreed as to these proportions. For instance,
Lefort has found 3.51 grains of nitrogenous matter in the cap of <i>Agaricus
campestris</i>, 2.1 grains in the gills and only 0.34 of a grain in the stem.
Payen has found 4.68 grains in <i>Agaricus campestris</i>, 4.4 grains in the
common Morel (<i>Morchella esculenta</i>), 9.96 grains in the white truffle,
and 8.76 grains in the black.</p>

<p>A much larger proportion of the various kinds of mushrooms are
edible than is generally supposed, but a prejudice has grown up concerning
them in this country which it will take some time to eradicate.
Notwithstanding the occurrence of occasional fatal accidents
through the inadvertent eating of poisonous species, fungi are largely
consumed both by savage and civilized man in all parts of the world,
and while they contribute so considerable a portion of the food product
of the world we may be sure their value will not be permanently overlooked
in the United States, especially when we consider our large
accessions of population from countries in which the mushroom is a
familiar and much prized edible. In Italy the value of the mushroom as
an article of diet has long been understood and appreciated. Pliny, Galen,
and Dioscorides mention various esculent species, notably varieties of the
truffle, the boletus and the puff-ball, and Vittadini writes enthusiastically
of the gastronomic qualities of a large number of species. Of late years
large quantities have been sold in the Italian markets. Quantities of
mushrooms are also consumed in Germany, Hungary, Russia, France,
and Austria.</p>

<p>Darwin speaks of Terra del Fuego as the only country where cryptogamic
plants form a staple article of food. A bright-yellow fungus allied
to <i>Bulgarin</i> forms, with shellfish, the staple food of the Fuegians. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1-14" id="Page_1-14">[Pg 1-14]</a></span>England the common meadow mushroom <i>Agaricus campestris</i> is quite
well known and used to a considerable extent among the people, but there
is not that general knowledge of and use of other species which obtains
in Continental Europe.</p>

<p>In the English-speaking countries much has been done by the Rev. M.
J. Berkeley, Dr. M. C. Cooke, Worthington G. Smith, Rev. John Stevenson,
Prof. Hay, Prof. Chas. H. Peck, Prof. W. J. Farlow, and others,
including the various mushroom clubs, to disseminate a more general
knowledge on this subject.</p>

<p>Late investigations show that nearly all the species common to the
countries of Continental Europe, and of Great Britain, are found in different
localities in the United States, and a number of species have been
found which have not been described in European works.</p>

<p>The geographical distribution of many species of the mushroom family
is very wide. We have had specimens of the <i>Morel</i>, for instance, sent to
us from California and Washington, on the Pacific coast, and as far north
as Maine, on the Atlantic, as well as from the southern and the midwestern
States, and the same is true of other species. The season of their
appearance varies somewhat according to the latitude and altitude of place
of growth. Mushrooms are rarely seen after the first heavy frosts, although
an exception is noted in this latitude in the species Hypholoma
sublatertium, which has been found growing under the snow, at the roots
of trees in sheltered woods. Frozen mushrooms of this and closely allied
species have revived when thawed, and proved quite palatable when
cooked.</p>

<p>At the present time only two species, Agaricus campester and Agaricus
arvensis, are cultivated in America. Some attempts have been made by
an amateur mushroom club in Ohio to cultivate the Morel, but the results
have not, so far, been reported. In the meantime, however, it is well to
utilize the wild mushrooms as fast as the collector can satisfactorily
identify them. The woods of all moist regions of this country abound
with edible varieties. Prof. Curtis, of North Carolina, gives a list of over
one hundred edible species found in that State alone, and nearly all of
these occur in our Northern States as well. It is not contended that this list
includes all the species which may be eaten, nor have all of these equal
value from a gastronomic point of view. Some are insipid as to flavor,
and others are too tough or too slimy to please the popular taste.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h1><a name="Suggestions"></a>CAUTIONARY SUGGESTIONS.</h1>


<p>Before collecting for the table mushrooms found growing in the woods
or fields, it would be well for inexperienced persons to consult carefully
some work on the subject in which the characteristics of edible and poisonous
varieties are described and illustrated.</p>

<p>Considering that an opinion seems to prevail that the discoloration of
the silver spoon or small white onions when brought into contact with
mushrooms during the culinary process is an infallible test of the poisonous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1-15" id="Page_1-15">[Pg 1-15]</a></span>species, I quote from a French author on mushrooms the following
in relation to this supposed test:</p>

<blockquote><p>* * * We may not dispute the fact that a silver spoon or article of brass, or
onions, may not become discolored on contact with the poisonous principle, but this
discoloration is not reliable as a test for deciding the good or bad quality of mushrooms.
In fact, we know that in the decomposition of albuminoids sulphureted hydrogen
is liberated which of itself discolors silver, brass, and onions.</p></blockquote>

<p>I have deemed it advisable to publish this as one of the best means of
answering those correspondents who have made inquiries as to the reliability
of this test.</p>

<p>It is by some supposed that high colors and viscidity are indications
of non-edible species, but there are numerous exceptions here. <i>Russula
alutacea</i>&mdash;the pileus of which is often a purplish red&mdash;<i>Amanita Cæsarea</i>,
and other species of brilliant coloring are known to be edible. As to viscidity,
two very viscid species, when young, are among the highly prized
esculents by those who know them, viz., <i>Fistulina hepatica</i>, or the ox
tongue, and <i>Hygrophorus eburneus</i>, the ivory mushroom.</p>

<p>The method of deciding the character of mushrooms by their odor and
flavor is not to be relied upon. Edible mushrooms are usually characterized
by a pleasant flavor and odor; non-edible varieties have sometimes
an unpleasant odor, and produce a biting, burning sensation on the tongue
and throat, even in very small quantities, but several of the <i>Amanitas</i>
have only a slight odor and taste, and certain species of mushrooms, acrid
otherwise, become edible when cooked.</p>

<p>In fact there is no general rule by which the edible species can be distinguished
from the unwholesome or poisonous ones. The safest as well
as the most sensible plan, therefore, is to apply the same rule as that
which we adopt in the case of the esculents among the flowering plants,
viz., to learn to know the characteristics of each individual species so as
to distinguish it from all others.</p>

<p>With regard to the mushrooms which have been designated as poisonous,
it should be remembered that the term "poisonous" is used relatively.
While some are only slightly poisonous, producing severe gastric irritation
and nervous derangement, but without fatal results, others, if eaten
in even very small quantity, may cause death. Happily, however, the most
dangerous species are not numerous as compared with the number that
are edible, and with careful attention on the part of the collector they
may be avoided.</p>

<p>Since the Amanita group is made responsible by competent authority
for most of the recorded cases of fatal poisoning, we would recommend the
amateur mycophagist to give special study to this group in order to learn
to separate the species authentically recorded as edible from the poisonous
ones.</p>

<p>Some writers, as a measure of precaution, counsel the rejection of all
species of Amanita. But this is, of course, a matter for individual preference.
There would seem to be no good reason why the observant student
should not learn to discriminate between the edible and the poisonous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1-16" id="Page_1-16">[Pg 1-16]</a></span>species of the Amanita as of any other group, and they should not be
eaten until this discriminating knowledge is acquired.</p>

<p>Saccardo describes fifteen edible species of this group of mushrooms.
We have tested three of this number, which, on account of their abundance
in our locality and their good flavor, we would be loth to discard,
viz., A. rubescens, A. Cæsarea, and A. strobiliformis.</p>

<p>A type of the Amanita group, which is named first in the genera of the
order Agaricini, is shown in Fig. 1, <a href="#PLATE_B">Plate B</a>.</p>

<p>By reference to this figure some of the special characteristics of the
group can be observed. There are mushrooms in other genera which
show a volva or sheath at the base of the stem, and which contain edible
species, but in these the stem is ringless. The Volvariæ, for instance,
show a conspicuous volva, a stem that is ringless, and pinkish spores.
The Amanitopsis vaginata carries a volva, but no ring. The spores are
white, as in the Amanita.</p>

<p>In gathering mushrooms either for the table or for the herbarium, care
should be taken not to leave any portion of the plant in the ground, so
that no feature shall be lost that will aid in characterizing the species.
In the careless pulling up of the plant the volva in the volvate species is

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Leucospori (spores white, or yellowish).</span></p>


<p><i>Genus Russula</i> Fr. The <i>Russulæ</i> bear some resemblance to the
<i>Lactars</i>, their nearest allies, but are at once distinguished from them by
their want of milk.</p>

<p>They are very abundant in the forests and open woods. The genus
is cited by some authors as the most natural of the agarics, but, as many
of the species very closely resemble each other, it requires careful analysis
to determine them. The plants of this genus are not volvate, and have
neither veil nor ring. The hymenophore is not separate from the trama
of the gills. Although some are pure white, the caps are usually brilliant
in coloring, but the color is very susceptible to atmospheric changes, and
after heavy rains the bright hues fade, sometimes only leaving a slight
trace of the original coloring in the central depression of the cap.</p>

<p>The cap in youth is somewhat hemispherical, afterwards expanding,
becoming slightly depressed in the centre, somewhat brittle in texture;
gills rigid, fragile, with acute edge; stem thick, blunt, and polished,
usually short. The spores are globose, or nearly so, slightly rough, white
or yellowish, according to the species. In R. virescens the spores are
white, while in R. alutacea the spores are an ochraceous yellow in tint.</p>

<p>A number of the species are of pleasant flavor, others peppery or acrid.
Out of seventy-two described by Cooke, twenty-four are recorded as acrid.
With some of these the acridity is said to disappear in cooking, and a few
mycophagists claim to have eaten all varieties with impunity. We have
recorded, however, some well authenticated cases of serious gastric disturbance,
accompanied by acute inflammation of the mucous membrane,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1-17" id="Page_1-17">[Pg 1-17]</a></span>caused by the more acrid of these, notably <i>R. emetica</i> and <i>R. f&oelig;tens</i>,
and in view of this fact it would seem a wise precaution for the <i>amateur</i>
collector to discard or at least to use very sparingly all those which have
an acrid or peppery taste, until well assured as to their wholesomeness.</p>

<p>The <i>genus Russula</i> has been divided into the following tribes or
groups:&mdash;Compactæ, Furcatæ, Rigidæ, Heterophylla, and Fragiles. The
species <i>Russula (Rigidæ) virescens</i>, illustrated in <a href="#PLATE_I">Plate I</a>, belongs to the
tribe Rigidæ. In the plants of this group, the cap is absolutely dry and
rigid, destitute of a viscid pellicle; the cuticle commonly breaking up
into flocci or granules; the flesh thick, compact, and firm, vanishing near
the margin, which is never involute, and shows no striations. The gills
are irregular in length, some few reaching half way to the stem, the
others divided, dilated, and extending into a broad rounded end, stem
solid.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Russula virescens</b> Fries. "<i>The Verdette</i>" <i>or</i> "<i>Greenish Russula</i>."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Edible</span>.</p>

<p>The cap of this species is fleshy and dry, the skin breaking into thin
patches. The margin is usually even, but specimens occur which show
striations. The color varies from a light green to a grayish or moldy
green, sometimes tinged with yellow; gills white, free from the stem or
nearly so, unequal, rather crowded; stem white, stout, solid, smooth, at
first hard, then spongy; spores white, nearly globose.</p>

<p>One writer speaks of the "warts" of the cap, but the term warts, used
in this connection, refers merely to the patches resulting from the splitting
or breaking up of the epidermis of the cap, and not to such excrescences
called warts, as are commonly observed on the cap of Amanita
muscaria, for instance, which are remnants of the volva.</p>

<p>The <i>R. virescens</i> is not as common as some others of the Russulæ, in
some localities, and hitherto seems to have attracted but little attention
as an edible species in this country, although highly esteemed in Europe.
It has been found growing in thin woods in Maryland and in Virginia
from June to November, and we have had reports of its growth from
New York and Massachusetts. The peasants in Italy are in the habit of
toasting these mushrooms over wood embers, eating them afterwards with
a little salt. Vittadini, Roques, and Cordier speak highly of its esculent
qualities and good flavor. We have eaten quantities of the virescens
gathered in Washington, D. C., and its suburbs, and found it juicy and of
good flavor when cooked.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Explanation of Plate I</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Coprinarii (spores black or nearly so).</span></p>


<p>Genus <i>Coprinus</i> Fries. Hymenophore distinct from the stem. Gills
membranaceous, at first coherent from the pressure, then dissolving into
a black fluid. Trama obsolete. Spores, oval, even, black. M. C. Cooke.</p>

<p>The plants of this genus have been divided into two tribes, viz., <i>Pelliculosi</i>
and <i>Veliformis</i>. In the <i>Pelliculosi</i> the gills of the mushrooms
are covered with a fleshy or membranaceous cuticle, hence the cap is not
furrowed along the lines of the gills, but is torn and revolute. In this
tribe are included the <i>Comati</i>, <i>Atramentarii</i>, <i>Picacei</i>, <i>Tomentosi</i>,
<i>Micacio</i> and <i>Glabrati</i>. In the tribe <i>Veliformis</i> the plants are generally
very small, and the cap much thinner than in those of the <i>Pelliculosi</i>,
soon showing distinct furrows along the back of the gills, which quickly
melt into very thin lines. The stem is thin and fistulose.</p>

<p>Cordier states that all the species of <i>Coprinus</i> are edible when young
and fresh. This is probably true, but most of them have so little substance
and are so ephemeral as to be of small value for food purposes.
<i>C. comatus</i>, <i>C. atramentarius</i>, <i>C. micaceus</i>, and <i>C. ovatus</i> have the
preference with most mycophagists, but even these soon melt, and should
be gathered promptly and cooked immediately to be of use for the table.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate II</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Coprinus comatus</b> Fries. <i>Maned or Shaggy Coprinus</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Edible</span>.</p>

<p>Cap at first oblong or cylindrical, then campanulate, the cuticle breaking
into shaggy fibrous scales, color whitish, the scales generally yellow
or yellowish, margin revolute and lacerated, soon becoming black. Gills
linear, free, and close together, at first white, then pink or purplish,
turning to black. Stem hollow or slightly stuffed, nearly equal, somewhat
fibrillose, with bulb solid; the ring movable or very slightly
adherent, generally disappearing as the plant matures. Spores oval,
black, .0005 to .0007 in. long.</p>

<p>This species is found in abundance in different parts of the United
States, generally in rich soil, in pastures, by roadsides, in dumping lots, etc.
Of late years quantities have been gathered in the lawn surrounding the
Capitol grounds, and in the parks of the District of Columbia, as well as
in the débris of the wooden block pavements used for surface soiling
gardens in vicinity of the capital. They have been offered for sale in
open market as low as 25 cents per pound.</p>

<p>A correspondent from Rochester, New York, states that in a patch of
his grounds which had been quarried out and filled with street sweepings
the Coprinus comatus appeared in such quantities as to make it impossible
to walk over the space without stepping upon them, and that he was able
to gather from this small space from one to two bushels at a time in the
spring and the fall. In flavor the C. comatus resembles the cultivated
mushroom, though perhaps more delicate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1-19" id="Page_1-19">[Pg 1-19]</a></span></p><p>The <i>Coprinus ovatus</i>, "<i>Oval Coprinus</i>," a closely allied species, is similar
to the comatus, but smaller, more ovate in shape and delicate in flavor,
less deliquescent; stem usually <span class="frac"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub></span> of an inch long. The <i>Coprinus atramentarius</i>
has a mouse-gray or brownish cap with irregular margin,
slightly striated. It is not shaggy, but is spotted with minute, innate
punctate scales. The stem is hollow, somewhat ringed when young.
Spores elliptical, black.</p>

<p><i>Coprinus micaceus</i> is a very common species, and is found generally
in clusters on old tree stumps or on decaying wood. The cap is thin and
of a reddish buff or ochraceous tint, often showing a sprinkling of glistening
micaceous scales or granules; gills crowded, whitish. It is at
first ovate or bell-shaped, then expanding; striated. The stem is white,
slender, and hollow, not ringed. The spores in this species are a very
dark brown, which is unusual in the genus <i>Coprinus</i>.</p>

<p>It is generally found in decaying wood or old tree-stumps, growing in
dense clusters.</p>

<p>Prof. Peck says: "European writers do not record the '<i>Glistening
coprinus</i>' among the edible species, perhaps because of its small size.
But it compensates for its lack of size by its frequency and abundance. In
tenderness and delicacy it does not appear to be at all inferior to the
'<i>Shaggy coprinus</i>.'"</p>

<p>Genus <i>Marasmius</i> Fries.&mdash;Tough dry shrivelling fungi&mdash;not putrescent,
reviving when moistened; veil none. Stem cartilaginous or horny.
Gills tough, rather distant, edge acute and entire. M. C. Cooke.</p>

<p>A characteristic of the species of this genus is their tendency to wither
with drought and revive with moisture. This biological characteristic is
of great importance in determining the true Marasmii. The plants are
usually small and of little substance.</p>

<p>Cooke divides the Marasmii into three tribes, and these again into
several subdivisions. In the division Scortei of this genus are classed
three species which are described in the works of most of the Continental
writers; the Marasmius oreades, which has recognized value as an esculent,
Marasmius urens and Marasmius peronatus, which have the reputation
of being acrid and unwholesome.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Marasmius oreades</b> Fries. "<i>Fairy Ring Mushroom</i>."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Edible</span>.</p>

<p>Cap fleshy, convex at first, then nearly plane, pale yellowish red, or
tawny red when young, fading to yellow or buff as the plant matures,
slightly umbonate, flesh white; gills broad, wide apart, rounded or
deeply notched at the inner extremity, slightly attached to or at length
free from the stem, unequal in length, whitish or creamy yellow in color;
stem slender, solid and tough, whitish, generally one to two inches in
length and one-fourth of an inch in thickness, showing a whitish down,
easily removed, not strigose or villose, as in the Marasmius urens. Spores
white.</p>

<p>This species is usually found in open grassy places, sometimes in rings,
or in parts of rings, often in clusters, and writers generally agree as to
its agreeable taste and odor. When properly cooked its toughness disappears.</p>

<p>Prof. Peck describes two mushrooms which are somewhat similar in
appearance to the "<i>Fairy Ring</i>," and which might be taken for it by
careless observers, viz., the Naucoria semi-orbicularis, sometimes growing
in company with it, and the <i>Collybia dryophila</i>, a wood variety which
is sometimes found in open places.</p>

<p>The first of these may be distinguished from the <i>oreades</i>, by the rusty
brown color of the gills, its smooth stem and rusty colored spores. In
the second the gills are much narrower and the stem is very smooth and
hollow.</p>

<p>The <i>Marasmius urens</i> as described by European authors has a pale
buff cap, not umbonate but flat, and at length depressed in the centre,
from one to two inches across. The gills are unequal, free, very crowded;
cream color, becoming brownish. The stem is solid and fibrous, densely
covered with white down at the base. It is very acrid to the taste. In
habit of growth it is subcæspitose; sometimes found growing in company
with the M. oreades.</p>

<p>Prof. Peck says of <i>M. urens</i> that he has not yet seen an American specimen
which he could refer to that species with satisfaction. Our experience,
so far, is the same as that of Prof. Peck.</p>

<p><i>Marasmius peronatus</i> has a reddish buff cap, with crowded thin gills,
creamy, turning to reddish brown; the stem solid and fibrous, with yellowish
filaments at the base. It is acrid in taste and is usually found
among fallen leaves in woods.</p>

<h2><a name="Preserving"></a><span class="smcap">Preserving and Cooking Mushrooms.</span></h2>

<p>In Europe several species of mushrooms are preserved by boiling and
afterwards placing them in earthern jars or tubs filled with water, which is
renewed from time to time. This simple and economical method of keeping
mushrooms affords the people considerable provision. With regard to
the preparation of fresh mushrooms for table use, Dr. Roques, an eminent
writer on fungi, gives the following excellent suggestions: "After selecting
good mushrooms, remove the skin or epidermis, cutting away the
gills, and in some cases the stem, which is usually of not so fine a texture.</p>

<p>"It is important to collect for use only young and well-preserved specimens,
because a mushroom of excellent quality may, nevertheless, when
overmature or near its decline, become dangerous for food. It then acts
as does every other food substance which incipient decomposition has
rendered acrid, irritating and indigestible. It is, moreover, rarely the
case that mushrooms in their decline are not changed by the presence of
larvæ."</p>

<p>In Geneva a very lucrative trade is carried on in the exportation of the
"<i>Edible Boletus</i>," which is preserved for use in various ways, the
simplest of which consists in cutting the caps in slices and stringing
them, after which they are placed on hurdles in the shade to dry. They
may also be dried in a stove or oven, but the former method is preferable,
as the mushroom then retains more of its flavor or perfume. When the
slices are perfectly dried they are put into sacks and suspended in a dry,
airy place. Sometimes before the mushrooms are sliced they are plunged
into boiling water for an instant, which treatment is said to preserve
them from the ravages of insects. Several kinds of mushrooms are
preserved in the following manner: After they have been properly
washed and cleansed, they are boiled in salted water and afterwards
wiped dry. They are then placed in layers, in jars, sprinkled with salt
and pepper, and covered with pure olive oil or vinegar. <i>Lactarius deliciosus</i>,
<i>Cantharellus cibarius</i>, <i>Morchellas</i>, <i>Clavarias</i>, etc., are thus
preserved. Before using the dried mushrooms they are soaked in tepid
water for some time and afterwards prepared as if fresh, with the usual
seasoning.</p>


<h2><a name="Receipts1"></a><span class="smcap">Receipts.</span></h2>

<p><i>Broiled procerus.</i>&mdash;Remove the scales and stalks from the agarics, and
broil lightly on both sides over a clear fire for a few minutes; arrange
them on a dish over freshly made, well-buttered toast; sprinkle with
pepper and salt and put a small piece of butter on each; set before a
brisk fire to melt the butter, and serve quickly. Bacon toasted over
mushrooms improves the flavor and saves the butter.</p>

<p><i>Agarics delicately stewed.</i>&mdash;Remove the stalks and scales from the
young half-grown agarics, and throw each one as you do so into a basin
of fresh water slightly acidulated with the juice of a lemon or a little
good vinegar. When all are prepared, remove them from the water and
put them in a stewpan with a very small piece of fresh butter. Sprinkle
with pepper and salt and add a little lemon juice; cover up closely and
stew for half an hour; then add a spoonful of flour with sufficient cream
or cream and milk, till the whole has the thickness of cream. Season to
taste, and stew again until the agarics are perfectly tender. Remove all
the butter from the surface and serve in a hot dish garnished with slices
of lemon. A little mace or nutmeg or catsup may be added, but some
think that spice spoils the flavor.</p>

<p><i>Cottager's procerus pie.</i>&mdash;Cut fresh agarics in small pieces; pepper,
salt, and place them on small shreds of bacon, in the bottom of a pie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1-22" id="Page_1-22">[Pg 1-22]</a></span>dish; then put in a layer of mashed potatoes, and so fill the dish, layer
by layer, with a cover of mashed potatoes for the crust. Bake well for
half an hour and brown before a quick fire.</p>

<p><i>A la provencale.</i>&mdash;Steep for two hours in some salt, pepper, and a
little garlic; then toss them into a small stewpan over a brisk fire with
parsley chopped and a little lemon juice.</p>

<p><i>Agaric catsup.</i>&mdash;Place the agarics of as large a size as you can procure,
layer by layer, in a deep pan, sprinkling each layer as it is put in
with a little salt. Then next day stir them several times well so as to
mash and extract their juice. On the third day strain off the liquor,
measure and boil for ten minutes, and then to every pint of liquor add
half an ounce of black pepper, a quarter of an ounce of bruised ginger
root, a blade of mace, a clove or two, and a teaspoonful of mustard seed.
Boil again for half an hour; put in two or three bay leaves and set aside
until quite cold. Pass through a strainer and bottle; cork well and dip
salt on the gills. Lay them top downwards on a gridiron over a moderate
fire for five or six minutes at the most.</p>

<p><i>To stew mushrooms.</i>&mdash;Trim and rub clean half a pint of large button
mushrooms. Put into a stewpan 2 ounces of butter; shake it over a fire
until thoroughly melted; put in the mushrooms, a teaspoonful of salt,
half as much pepper, and a blade of mace pounded; stew until the mushrooms
are tender, then serve on a hot dish. This is usually a breakfast
dish.</p>

<p><i>Mushrooms à la crême.</i>&mdash;Trim and rub half a pint of button mushrooms;
dissolve in a stewpan 2 ounces of butter rolled in flour; put in
the mushrooms, a bunch of parsley, a teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful
each of white pepper and of powdered sugar; shake the pan for ten
minutes; then beat up the yolks of two eggs with two tablespoonfuls of
cream, and add by degrees to the mushrooms; in two or three minutes
you can serve them in sauce.</p>

<p><i>Mushrooms on toast.</i>&mdash;Put a pint of mushrooms into a stewpan with
two ounces of butter rolled in flour; add a teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful
of white pepper, a blade of powdered mace, and a half a teaspoonful
of grated lemon; stew until the butter is all absorbed; then
serve on toast as soon as the mushrooms are tender.</p>

<h1><a name="Ascomycetes"></a>ASCOMYCETES.</h1>


<p>Fruit, consisting of sporidia, mostly definite, contained in asci, springing
from a naked or enclosed stratum of fructifying cells, and forming a
hymenium.&mdash;Cooke and Berkeley.</p>

<p>Prof. J. de Seyne states that the three elements which form the hymenium
in the families Hymenomycetes and Gasteromycetes are (1) the
normal basidium, that is, the fruitful club-shaped cell which supports the
naked spores, (2) the cystidium or sterile cell, an aborted or atrophied
basidium, and (3) the paraphyses, hypertrophied basidium, the one organ,
the basidium, being the basis of it all, according as it experiences an arrest
of development, as it grows and fructifies, or as it becomes hypertrophied.</p>

<p>In the family Ascomycetes a minute ascus or spore case envelops the
sporidia, and takes the place of the basidium, and the hymenium consists
of (1) the asci containing the sporidia, (2) the paraphyses, and (3) a colorless
or yellowish mucilage which envelops the paraphyses and asci. The
asci are present in all species. In some species, however, the paraphyses
are rare, and the mucilaginous substance is entirely wanting. The asci
differ in shape and size, according to the species. The paraphyses,
when present, are at first very short, but they rapidly elongate, and
are wholly developed before the appearance of the asci. They are
linear, simple or branched according to the species of plant, usually containing
oily granules. There is some difference of opinion among mycologists
as to the special functions of the paraphyses, some considering
them as abortive asci, and others, like Boudier, as excitatory organs for
the dehiscence of the asci, by which the spores are liberated.</p>

<p>The family Ascomycetes is rich in genera and species.</p>

<p>It consists largely of microscopic fungi, however, and the only group
which will be considered here is that which includes plants of the mushroom
family which are edible and indigenous to this country, viz., the sub-family
Discomycetes.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h1><a name="Discomycetes"></a>DISCOMYCETES.</h1>


<p>The name Discomycetes, "disk-like fungi," does not give an accurate
idea of the distinguishing characteristics of this sub-family, the discoid
form only belonging to the plants of one of its groups. In the Discomyceteæ
the hymenium is superior, that is, disposed upon the upper or exterior
surface of the mushroom cap. The sporidia are produced in membraneous
asci, usually four or eight, or some multiple of that number,
in each ascus; Cooke says "rarely four, most commonly eight." The
sporidia are usually hyaline, transparent; colored sporidia are rare.</p>

<p>The asci are so minute as to be imperceptible to the naked eye; but if
a small portion of the upper surface of the cap is removed with a pen
knife and placed under a microscope having a magnifying power of from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2-4" id="Page_2-4">[Pg 2-4]</a></span>400 to 800 diameters, the asci, or spore sacks, can be separated and their
structure studied.</p>

<p>Of the genera included in the Discomycetes the genus Peziza comprises
by far the largest number of described species. The plants in this
genus are generally small, thin, and tough. A few of them have been
recorded as edible by European authors, but not specially commended;
one form, Peziza <i>cochleata</i>, has been spoken of by Berkeley as being
gathered in basketfuls in one county in England, where it is used as a
substitute, though a very indifferent one, for the Morel.</p>

<p>Vittadini says the Verpa <i>digitaliformis</i> Persoon, a small brownish-colored
mushroom, is sold in Italian markets for soups, but that, "although
sold in the markets, it is only to be recommended when no other fungus
offers, which is sometimes the case in the spring." P. <i>aurantia</i> Vahl., a
small Peziza growing in clusters in the grass, is reported as edible by a
member of the Boston Mycological Club, who speaks well of it.</p>

<p>The genera Morchella, Gyromitra, Helvella, and Mitrula contain, however,
what may be considered the most desirable edible species. Types
of these four groups are represented in Figs. 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10, <a href="#PLATE_C">Plate C</a>.</p>

<p>The plants of these genera have a stem and cap. The cap, however,
differs very much from that of the ordinary mushroom. In the genus
Morchella the cap is deeply pitted and ridged so that it presents a honeycombed
appearance. In Gyromitra the cap is convolutely lobed but not
pitted. In Helvella the cap is very irregular and reflexed, and in Mitrula
the cap is ovate or club shaped and smooth. In all four of these genera
the hymenium is superior, <i>i. e.</i>, it is on the upper and outer surface of the
cap, the interior surface being barren.</p>

<p>In <a href="#PLATE_C">Plates C</a> and <a href="#PLATE_D">D</a> are figured 9 types of edible fungi included in the
family Ascomycetes, sub-family Discomycetes.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1. <b>Morchella esculenta</b> Pers. "<i>Common Morel</i>."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Edible.</span></p>

<p><i>Genus Morchella</i> Dill. Receptacle pileate or clavate, impervious in the
centre, stipitate, covered with hymenium, which is deeply folded and
pitted.&mdash;Cooke.</p>

<p>In this genus the species have a general resemblance to each other in
size, color, form, texture, and flavor. The cap is usually a dull yellow,
sometimes slightly olive-tinted, darkening with age to a brownish leather
tinge. The stems are stout and hollow, white or whitish. This genus has
a very wide geographical distribution, but the species are not numerous.
Cooke describes twenty-four, some of them found in India, Java, Great
Britain, Central and Northern Europe, Australia, and North America.
Peck describes six species found in New York State. The lines of demarcation
between species are not very decided; but as none of the species
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2-5" id="Page_2-5">[Pg 2-5]</a></span>are known to be poisonous, it may be considered a safe genus to experiment
with.</p>

<p>In the Morchella esculenta the cap is ovate, in one variety rotund, the
margin attaching itself to the stem; ribs firm and anastomosing, forming
deep hollows or pits; color yellowish tan, olivaceous; spores hyaline,
colorless; asci very long. The Morel, though rare in some localities, is
found in large quantities in some of the midwestern States, sometimes in
the woods along the borders of streams, often in peach orchards, at the
roots of decaying trees.</p>

<p>I am informed by correspondents who have collected and eaten them
that the Morels can be gathered in abundance in the springtime along the
banks of the Missouri and tributary streams. A lieutenant in the United
States Army informs me that he found fine specimens of this species in
the mountains of California, five or six thousand feet above sea-level. A
correspondent, Mr. H. W. Henshaw, writes that he has made many
excellent meals of them, finding them on the banks of Chico Creek,
Sacramento Valley, California, on Gen. Bidwell's ranch, in April. A correspondent
in Minnesota writes: "The Morel grows abundantly in some
places here, but so prejudiced are many of the natives against 'toad-stools'
that I had to eat the Morel alone for a whole season before I
could induce any one else to taste it." Mr. Hollis Webster, of the Boston
Mycological Club, reports the Morchella <i>conica</i> as appearing in abundance
in eastern Massachusetts in May of this year. A correspondent in
West Virginia reports that quantities of a large-sized Morel are found in
the mountain regions there.</p>

<p>I have reports also of the appearance of the Morel in Western New
York, and on the coast of Maine and of Oregon. A miner writes to me
from Montana that he and several other miners, having lost their way in
the mountains of that State during the spring of the year, subsisted
entirely for five days on Morels which they collected.</p>

<p>The specimen represented in <a href="#PLATE_C">Plate C</a>, Fig. 1, is figured from a
Morchella <i>esculenta</i> which grew in the vicinity of Falls Church, Va., less
than ten miles from the District of Columbia. The reports which I have
received from correspondents in twenty States show that the Morel is not
so rare in this country as was formerly supposed. The advantages which
this mushroom possesses over some others are (1) the readiness with
which it can be distinguished, (2) its keeping qualities, and (3) its
agreeable taste. It is easily dried, and in that condition can be kept a
long time without losing its flavor. Though it has not the rich flavor of
the common field mushroom, it is very palatable when cooked, and when
dried it is often used in soups. It is very generally esteemed as an
esculent among mycophagists.</p>

<p>Fig. 2 represents the sporidia enclosed in the ascus, or spore sack,
with accompanying paraphyses.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2-6" id="Page_2-6">[Pg 2-6]</a></span></p><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 3. <b>Gyromitra</b> <i>esculenta</i> Fries. "<i>Esculent Gyromitra</i>."</p>

<p><i>Genus Gyromitra</i> Fries. This genus contains very few species, but
all are considered edible, though differing somewhat in flavor and digestibility.
Five or six species are figured by Cooke. Peck speaks of
several species found in New York. One of these, G. curtipes Fries,
is also figured by Cooke as found in North Carolina. This species
Cooke regards as equal in flavor to G. esculenta. G. esculenta has a
rounded, inflated cap, irregularly lobed and hollow, smooth and brittle in
texture, reddish brown. It falls over the stem in heavy convolutions,
touching it at various points. The stem is stout, stuffed, at length
hollow, whitish or cinereous; spores elliptical with two nuclei, yellowish,
translucent. The plant is usually from two to four inches in height,
but larger specimens are found.</p>

<p>Fig. 4 represents the spore sack with enclosed sporidia.</p>

<p>Mr. Charles L. Fox, of Portland, Maine, records the Gyromitra <i>esculenta</i>,
of which he sent me a very good specimen last spring, as quite
abundant during May in the open woods near the city named. Speaking
of this species, he says: "From the point of view of their edibility, we
have classed them under two heads&mdash;the light and the dark varieties.
These differ in the locality in which they are found, in their color and in
the convolutions of their surface. Both grow large.</p>

<p>"The <i>Light Gyromitra</i> is the more easily digested of the two. Its
height varies from three to five inches, cap three to five inches in diameter.
Its cap is inflated, very irregular, and twisted in large convolutions.
These convolutions are almost smooth on the surface, sometimes showing
small depressions; margin generally attached to the stem in parts. It is
a transparent yellow in color. This variety does not grow dark brown
with age. Stem white or very light buff, smooth, and hollow. It grows
best on slopes facing the south, in scant woods of birch, maple, and pine.
We have found no specimens in open places or on the borders of woods.</p>

<p>"The <i>Dark Gyromitra</i> is more common than the light variety. Its color
is generally of dark lake brown, even in the young plant, though it is
sometimes of a light warm yellow, which grows darker with age. Stem
flesh-colored or pallid, but not white, nor so light as in the first variety.
Its cap is similar in its large convolutions to that of the light variety,
but it is covered with many intricate vermiform ridges, sometimes in high
relief or even strongly undercut. Grows in mossy places, in light sandy
soil, on borders of pine woods. Its flesh is brittle, but not so tender as
that of the first variety. Both varieties dry readily. We should advise
eating the <i>Dark Gyromitra</i> only in moderate amounts, as, if eaten
in quantity, or if old specimens are used, indigestion or nausea is liable
to follow. In regard to both varieties, I would advise that only young
specimens should be eaten at first, as they are more tender and less pronounced
in flavor than the older plants. We have eaten, however, a considerable
quantity of the <i>Light Gyromitra</i> with no unpleasant results.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2-7" id="Page_2-7">[Pg 2-7]</a></span>The flavor of the Gyromitras is quite strong, and some have found it too
much so to be agreeable on the first eating. The general opinion here, however,
is favorable to the Gyromitra as an excellent addition to the table."</p>

<p>Some German authorities speak well of the flavor of the G. esculenta,
and it is sold in the German markets. Cordier records it as agreeable in
taste when cooked. Peck says that he has repeatedly eaten it without
experiencing any evil results, but does not consider its flavor equal to
that of a first-class mushroom. He advises also that it should be eaten
with moderation, and that only perfectly fresh specimens should be used,
sickness having resulted from eating freely of specimens that had been
kept twenty-four hours before being cooked.</p>

<p>I have not been fortunate in securing a sufficient quantity of fresh
specimens to test its edible qualities personally, but the testimony received
from those who have eaten it seems to point to the necessity for moderation
in eating and care in securing fresh specimens to cook.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 5. <b>Helvella crispa</b>. "<i>Crisp Helvella</i>."</p>

<p><i>Genus Helvella</i> Linn. The plants of this genus are usually small,
though a few of the species are of good size. They are not plentiful, but
they are very generally regarded as edible, the flavor bearing a resemblance
to that of the Morel. The cap has a smooth, not polished, surface,
and is very irregular, revolute, and deflexed, not honeycombed like the
Morel, nor showing the brain-like convolutions of the Gyromitras. Color
brownish pale tan, or whitish. The stem in the larger species is stout,
and sometimes deeply furrowed in longitudinal grooves, usually white or
whitish.</p>

<p>The species Helvella crispa is white or pallid throughout, cap very
irregular, sometimes deeply concave in the centre, with margin at first
erect, then drooping; again it is undulating, much divided and deflexed;
in fact, so irregular is the shape that scarcely two specimens will show
the cap the same in outline; stem stout and deeply channelled. Spores
elliptical, transparent. Habitat woods, growing singly or in groups, but
not cæspitose.</p>

<p>Fig. 6, the ascus or spore sack and paraphyses.</p>


<p><i>Genus Mitrula</i> Fries. Soft and fleshy, simple capitate, stem distinct,
hymenium surrounding the inflated cap; head ovate, obtuse, inflated.&mdash;M.
C. Cooke.</p>

<p>Cooke says of this genus that it is scarcely so well characterized as
many with which it is associated, and that some of the species are evidently
so closely allied to some of the species of the genus Geoglossum
that it is difficult to draw the line of demarcation between them, particularly
so with the species Mitrula <i>pistillaris</i> B. from Louisiana.</p>

<p>The plants are very small, and though none are recorded as poisonous,
only one or two have any value as esculents.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2-8" id="Page_2-8">[Pg 2-8]</a></span></p><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 7. <b>Mitrula sclerotipes</b> Boudier.</p>

<p>The cap in this species is small, and the stem long and slender. The
spores are transparent, the asci club-shaped. The plants of this species
are always found springing from an oblong sclerotium; hence the name
sclerotipes.</p>

<p>Fig. 8 represents the sporidia enclosed in their asci with paraphyses

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 10. <b>Mitrula vitellina</b> Sacc., var. <i>irregularis</i> Peck.</p>

<p>Saccardo, in his Sylloge Fungorum, includes in this genus those
having a club-shaped cap, which brings into it, with others, the species
Mitrula <i>vitellina</i> Sacc., formerly classed in the genus Geoglossum, and
its variety <i>irregularis</i> Peck. The latter was first described in 1879, in
Peck's Thirty-Second Report, under the name Geoglossum <i>irregulare</i>.
Prof. Peck now gives preference to the name assigned to it by Saccardo,
and it is so recorded in Peck's later reports.</p>

<p>Prof. Peck records this species as edible, and recommends it as having
tender flesh and an agreeable flavor. It sometimes grows in profusion
in wet mossy places, in woods, or swampy ground. It is bright yellow
in color, clean and attractive. The cap is much longer than the stem,
often deeply lobed, extremely irregular in outline, and tapers to a short
yellowish or whitish stem. The spores are narrowly elliptical and transparent.
The specimen illustrated is from a small one figured by Peck.
The plants sometimes reach two inches in height. They are most abundant
in temperate climates.</p>

FOUR TYPES OF THE GENUS MORCHELLA.<br />

</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate D.</span></p>

<p>In Plate D are represented four species of the genus Morchella, viz.,
M. <i>semilibera</i>, M. <i>bispora</i>, M. <i>conica</i>, and M. <i>deliciosa</i>. Morchella
<i>esculenta</i> is figured in <a href="#PLATE_C">Plate C</a>.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1. <b>Morchella semilibera</b> De Candolle. "<i>Half Free Morel</i>."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Edible.</span></p>

<p>Cap conical but half free from the stem as the name of the species
indicates. The ribs are longitudinal, forming oblong pits; stem hollow,
much longer than the cap, white; spores elliptical. Peck says that this
species has been described by Persoon under the name Morchella <i>hybrida</i>,
and this name is adopted in Saccardo's Sylloge Fungorum, but most
English writers prefer the first.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Edible.</span></p>

<p>Cap free from the stem to the top, somewhat resembling that of
M. <i>semilibera</i>, but blunt at its summit instead of conical, the outward
surface deeply pitted, inner surface smooth and barren. A characteristic
of this species which distinguishes it from others of the same genus is
found in the number of its sporidia, spores as seen in the ascus or spore
sack. In the plants of the genus Morchella the spore sacks, with one or
two exceptions, contain eight spores.</p>

<p>In the species M. <i>bispora</i> the spore sacks contain but two spores and
these are much larger than the sporidia of those which contain eight.
This characteristic, however, can only be determined by the aid of the
microscope.</p>

<p>Cooke figures a specimen taken from those published by Sorokin in
Thumen's Exsiccata, and calls it a variety of Morchella <i>Bohemica</i> Kromb.
He says that it is not unusual to find M. <i>Bohemica</i> with two or four
sporidia in some of the asci, mixed with others containing more, some
specimens being entirely tetrasporous, and some, as the variety <i>bispora</i>,
usually containing but two sporidia. Cooke contends that M. bispora is
simply a bisporous form of Morchella <i>Bohemica</i>, and calls it M. <i>Bohemica</i>
var. <i>bispora</i>. It is not as common as other species.</p>

<p>Fig. 9 represents asci of M. bispora showing the two spores in each
ascus.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 4. <b>Morchella conica.</b> "<i>Conical Morel</i>."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Edible.</span></p>

<p>Cap conical or oblong-conical, margin adhering to the stem, the prominent
ridges longitudinal and irregularly bisected with shorter ones; the
whole plant hollow throughout; color pale tan or ochraceous yellow,
growing dingy and darker with age; stem white; spores elliptical.</p>

<p>This species is quite plentiful in some localities; the flavor is like that
of M. <i>esculenta</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 6. <b>Morchella deliciosa</b> Fries. "<i>Delicious Morel</i>."</p>

<p>Cap nearly cylindrical, blunt at the top, and usually much longer than
the stem, adnate. Plant hollow throughout. Stem white. Spores
elliptical.</p>

<p>Fig. 7. Sectional view of M. <i>deliciosa</i>.</p>

<p>The Morchella <i>deliciosa</i> is highly esteemed as an esculent wherever
eaten. Split open and stuffed with bread crumbs seasoned with pepper,
salt, and butter and a pinch of thyme or onion, steamed in a hot oven, and
served with butter sauce, this mushroom makes a very savory dish.</p>

<p class="center">AGARICINI. Fries.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Leucospori (spores white or yellowish).</span></p>


<p><i>Genus Lactarius</i> Fries. The plants of this genus have neither veil
nor volva. They somewhat resemble the <i>Russulæ</i>, but can be readily
distinguished from them by the greater fleshiness of the stem and by the
milky juice which exudes from the flesh. The latter is a characteristic
feature of the <i>Lactars</i>, giving to the group its name.</p>

<p>The species were originally arranged by Fries into groups according to
the color and quality of the milk, and of the naked or pruinose character
of the gills. Prof. Peck, however, considering the latter character not
sufficiently constant or obvious to be satisfactory, in his early reports
makes the color of the milk alone the basis of the primary grouping of
the American species.</p>

<p>Saccardo, in his Sylloge, follows Fries in his classification of the species
of the genus Lactarius.</p>

<p>In some species the milk is at first bright colored and continues unchanged;
in others it is always white or whitish, and in others again it is
at first white, changing to different hues on exposure to the air, becoming
pinkish, pale violet, or yellow. In one species (C. indigo) both plant and
milk are of indigo blue. The taste of the milk varies, as does that of the
flesh, according to species. Sometimes it is mild or very slightly acrid, and
again it resembles Cayenne pepper in its hot, biting acridity. It is somewhat
viscid or sticky in character, and permeates to some extent the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2-11" id="Page_2-11">[Pg 2-11]</a></span>flesh of the mushroom, but is most profuse in the gills, where in fresh
young specimens it is seen exuding on the slightest pressure. In old or
wilted specimens it does not flow so freely, but may be found by breaking
off portions of the cap.</p>

<p>The plants usually present a fleshy cap, the flesh quite brittle, and
breaking in clean, even fractures. In a number of the species the upper
surface of the cap shows bands or zones of warm coloring, not found in any
of the species of the allied genus Russula. The gills are sometimes even,
more often forked, acute on the edge, color white or whitish, but changing
to yellowish or reddish tints as the plants mature, or when cut or bruised.
While they are at first adnate they become, with the expansion of the cap,
somewhat decurrent, showing in this particular a resemblance to the
plants of the genus Clitocybe. The stem is central, except in a few species,
where it is eccentric or lateral, notably the latter in L. <i>obliquus</i>;
spores white or yellowish, according to species; Cooke says, "rarely turning
yellow." They are globose, or nearly so, and slightly rough.</p>

<p>This genus is a large one, and contains many acrid species. Out of
fifty-three described and figured by Cooke, more than half are given as
having the milk more or less acrid. More than forty species have been
recorded as growing in this country, and many of these are extremely
acrid in taste.</p>

<p>A number of the species are edible, while others have been recorded as
deleterious, poisonous, etc. L. torminosus, L. piperatus, and L. insulsus
are species about which there seems to be difference of opinion among
authors as to their wholesomeness or edibility, some contending that, in
spite of their extreme acridity, they are edible when cooked, and others
that they are deleterious in their effects. L. <i>deliciosus</i> and L. <i>volemus</i> have
a good reputation in this country as well as abroad, and are quite abundant
in some localities. They are more frequent in temperate climates
than in northern latitudes or in the tropics.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Lactarius deliciosus</b> Fries. "<i>Delicious Lactarius</i>" <i>or</i> "<i>Orange Milk Mushroom</i>."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Edible.</span></p>

<p>Cap fleshy, viscid, at first convex, then nearly plane, becoming much
depressed in the centre, funnel-shaped, marked in the adult plant with
rings or rust-colored zones. Color of the cap dull orange, turning paler,
and grayish or greenish yellow when old or dried; margin at first turned
inwards; flesh whitish or tinged with yellow; gills decurrent, crowded
rather thick, sometimes slightly forked at the base, pale yellow, sometimes
a saffron yellow, exuding when bruised a saffron-red or orange-colored
liquid, hence the popular name of "Orange Milk Mushroom;" stem
smooth, somewhat spotted, stout, stuffed with a yellowish pith, eventually
becoming hollow; color about the same as that of the cap. Spores
subglobose, yellowish. Taste mild or very slightly acrid when raw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2-12" id="Page_2-12">[Pg 2-12]</a></span>Mycophagists generally concur in the opinion that it is of very pleasant
flavor when cooked, and some speak very enthusiastically of its esculent
qualities.</p>

<p>Over-cooking is apt to make it tough. I find steaming in the oven
with butter, pepper, and salt, and a very small quantity of water, as
oysters are steamed, a very good method of preserving the juices and
flavor.</p>

<p>It is found in Maryland, under the pines and sometimes in mossy and
swampy places. Prof. Underwood, President of the New York Mycological
Club, reports it as fairly abundant in Connecticut.</p>

<p>Lactarius <i>volemus</i> Fries, the "Orange-Brown Lactar," somewhat resembles
the L. <i>deliciosus</i> in shape and size, but the cap is dry and glabrous
and the skin is apt to crack in patches in somewhat the same manner as
does that of the Russula <i>virescens</i>. It is a warm orange-brown in color,
varying slightly with age, and is not zoned. The gills are white or yellowish
and crowded, adnate in the young specimens, and decurrent in the
mature, exuding a white milk when bruised. The spores are globose, and
white. It is found in open woods. The flavor is much like that of
L. <i>deliciosus</i>, although perhaps not so rich.</p>

<p>One author states it as his experience that the Lactars which have
<i>bright</i>-colored milk, unchanging, are usually edible and have a mild taste.
L. <i>indigo</i> Schwein has been recorded as less abundant than some other
species, but edible. The plant is a deep blue throughout, the milk of the
same color and unchanging. The taste of both flesh and milk is mild.
Specimens of this species were sent to me from western New York
several years ago by a correspondent who found it growing in quantities
in a corn field. He had cooked several dishes of it, and reported its
flavor as very agreeable.</p>

<p>L. <i>vellereus</i> and L. <i>piperatus</i> are very common in fir woods. The plants
are large and stout, white throughout, the milk white and excessively
acrid; gills decurrent, unequal and narrow. The milk in <i>vellereus</i> is apt
to be scanty but copious in <i>piperatus</i>.</p>

<p>Of L. <i>piperatus</i>, Worthington Smith says: "So strongly acrid is the
milk that if it be allowed to trickle over tender hands it will sting like
the contact of nettles; and if a drop be placed on the lips or tongue the
sensation will be like the scalding of boiling water." He records it as
"poisonous." Fries and Curtis say that, "notwithstanding its intense
acridity, it is edible when cooked." Cordier, while recording it as edible,
says that the milk, and butter made from the milk of cows fed with it, are
bitter and nauseous, although cows eat it with avidity. Gibson, while
quoting one or two authors as to its edibility when cooked, says: "Its
decidedly ardent tang warns me not to dwell too enthusiastically upon
its merits in a limited selection of desirable esculents." The Secretary
of the Boston Mycological Club, writing in the Club bulletin, says
"it has been eaten as a sort of duty after the acridity was cooked out,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2-13" id="Page_2-13">[Pg 2-13]</a></span>but does not commend it. It is spoken of as "an unattractive fungus
which usurps in the woods the place that might well be occupied by
something better." In this opinion I fully concur.</p>

<p>L. <i>torminosus</i>, "<i>Wooly Lactarius</i>," sometimes called the "<i>Colic Lactarius</i>,"
has been termed acrid and poisonous by Badham. Cordier and
Letellier, on the other hand, say that it can be eaten with impunity when
cooked. Gillet declares it deleterious and even dangerous in the raw
state, constituting a very strong and drastic purgative. One author
states that, although it does not constitute an agreeable article of food,
it is eaten in some parts of France and in Russia. Considering the differences
of opinion which exist with regard to this and other extremely
acrid species, it would seem the part of prudence for persons with delicate
stomachs to avoid the use of very acrid species, for, though the acridity
may be expelled by cooking, there would seem to be no necessity
for risking unpleasant or dangerous results while the range of unquestionably
wholesome and agreeable species is sufficiently wide to satisfy
the most enthusiastic mycophagist.</p>




<p class="center">AGARICINI.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Leucospori (spores white or yellowish).</span></p>


<p>Armillaria Fries. Cooke places Armillaria in the order Agaricini, <i>genus
Agaricus</i>, making of it a <i>sub</i>-genus. Saccardo, in taking it out of Agaricus,
elevates it to the position of a separate genus. The name Armillaria
is derived from a Greek word, meaning a ring or bracelet, referring to its
ringed stem.</p>

<p>In the plants of the Armillaria the veil is partial in infancy, attaching
the edge of the cap to the upper part of the stem; the stem furnished
with a ring. Below the ring the veil is concrete with the stem, forming
scurfy scales upon it. The gills are broadly adnexed. In abnormal
specimens the ring is sometimes absent, or appearing only in scales, running
down the stem. Spores white. The species are few; eight are recorded
as growing in the United States. Cooke describes twelve species
found in Great Britain.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Ag. (Armillaria) melleus</b> Vahl. "<i>Honey-Colored Armillaria.</i>"</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Edible.</span></p>

<p>Cap fleshy, rather thin at the margin, at first subconical, then slightly
rounded, or nearly plane, clothed with minute hairy tufts; margin sometimes
striate, color varying, usually a pale-yellowish or honey color or light
reddish brown; flesh whitish. Gills whitish or paler than the cap, growing
mealy with the shedding of the profuse white spores, and often
spotted with reddish-brown stains, adnate, ending with decurrent tooth.
Stem fibrillose, elastic, stuffed or hollow, ringed, and adorned with floccose
scales which often disappear with age; in some varieties distinctly bulbous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2-14" id="Page_2-14">[Pg 2-14]</a></span>at the base, in others showing tapering root. Specimens occur in which
the ring is wanting or only traces of it appear in the form of scales encircling
the stem. Veil usually firm, membraneous, and encircling the
stem in a well-pronounced ring or collar, but sometimes filmy as a spider's
web, in very young specimens hiding the gills, but breaking apart as the
cap expands.</p>

<p>Manner of growth cæspitose, generally on decayed tree stumps, although
the group figured in the plate was found growing on moist sand,
mixed with clay, on a roadside in Hynesbury Park.</p>

<p>Authors differ widely as to the value of this species as an esculent. I have
only eaten the very young and small specimens when cooked, and found
them very palatable. A Boston mycophagist records it as "very good,"
fried after five minutes' boiling in salted water. Prof. Peck, having tried it,
considers it "a perfectly safe species, but not of first-rate quality." It is
very common in Maryland and Virginia, and in the mountain districts
prolific. I have talked with Bohemians and with Germans who have gathered
it in basketfuls in the vicinity of the District of Columbia, who speak
well of it, considering it a valuable addition to the table. Its prolific
growth makes it valuable to those who like it. There are no species recorded
as dangerous in this group.</p>

<p>Ag. (Armillaria) robustus, a very stout species, with a fleshy, compact,
smooth cap, bay color or tawny, occurs in the Maryland woods, and in
the open woods of the Massachusetts coast.</p>




<p class="center">AGARICINI. Fries.</p>


<p><i>Genus Cantharellus</i> Adans. In the plants of this genus the hymenophore
or fleshy substance of the cap is continuous with the stem. They
are fleshy, membranaceous, and putrescent, having neither veil, ring, nor
volva. The stem is central, except in a few species, where it is lateral.
A characteristic of the genus which separates it from other genera of the
Agaricini is the vein-like appearance of the gills. They are very shallow
and so obtuse on the edges as to present the appearance of a network of
swollen branching veins. They are usually decurrent and anastomosing.
It is a small genus. Cooke figures nineteen species. Among the described
species C. cibarius is the only one whose edible qualities have
been highly recommended. C. umbonatus, a very small plant, found in
eastern Massachusetts is commended by those who have eaten it.
They are usually found in woods, and amongst moss. One species, <i>C.
carbonatus</i>, is found upon charred ground.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Cantharellus cibarius</b> Fries. "<i>The Edible Chantarelle</i>."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Edible.</span></p>

<p>Cap a rich golden yellow, like the yolk of an egg; at first convex, later
concave and turbinated; margin sinuous, undulate, smooth, shining, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2-15" id="Page_2-15">[Pg 2-15]</a></span>more or less lobed; diameter from two to four inches; flesh pale yellow
or whitish; veins or gills rather thick and wiry, remarkably decurrent,
usually very much bifurcated and of the same golden yellow as the cap;
stem solid or stuffed, slightly attenuated downwards, yellow; spores
white or pale yellowish, elliptical.</p>

<p>European authors esteem it very highly, and some speak of the odor as
like that of ripe apricots. The plant as found in Maryland and Virginia
has a slightly pungent but agreeable taste when raw, and a pleasant odor
when cooked. It is ranked as one of the best of the wood mushrooms by
those who have eaten it in this locality (District of Columbia). It is
found here in abundance, after light rains, in fir woods. Berkeley states
that it is somewhat rare in England, where it is held as a delicacy, but
quite common on the continent. We have had specimens from various
localities throughout the States. Cooke says the spores are white. Peck
and Gibson record them as yellow. I find them white, sometimes slightly
tinted with yellow.</p>

<p>The <i>Chantarelle</i> takes its name from a Greek word signifying a cup or
vase, referring to its shape and possibly also to its rich golden color; <i>cibarius</i>
refers to its esculent qualities.</p>

<p>The variety <i>rufipes</i> Gillet closely resembles C. <i>cibarius</i>, but is darker,
with the stem <i>rufous</i>, reddish, at the base.</p>

<p>C. <i>aurantiacus</i> Fries bears a sufficient resemblance to C. <i>cibarius</i> to
be sometimes taken for it, although the cap is tomentose and of a much
deeper orange in tint, the gills more crowded, darker than the cap, and
the stem less stout. In the variety <i>pallidus</i> the whole plant is very light
or buff yellow, and the gills nearly white. C. aurantiacus has been recorded
as poisonous or unwholesome by some of the earlier authors,
others say that they have eaten it, but do not commend it.</p>

<h1><a name="Receipts2"></a>RECEIPTS FOR COOKING.</h1>


<p><i>Stuffed Morels.</i>&mdash;Choose the freshest and lightest colored Morels, open
the stalk at the base, fill with minced veal and bread-crumbs, secure the
ends of the stalk and place between thin slices of bacon.</p>

<p>The Morel should not be gathered immediately after heavy rains, as it
becomes insipid with much moisture. The flavor is said to grow stronger
in drying.</p>

<p><i>Escalloped Mushrooms.</i>&mdash;(From Mr. Frank Caywood, Fredericktown,
Ohio, November 14, 1893.) Season as directed in the usual methods for
mushrooms and add a small quantity of vinegar to hasten the cooking.
Cook slowly until tender; rapid boiling evaporates the flavor. When
done, put in from a pint to a quart of sweet milk and heat. Take a pudding
dish and put in a layer of broken crackers; light milk crackers are
the best. Put lumps of butter and pepper and salt over the crackers.
Next a layer of the tender mushrooms with some of the hot gravy and
milk. Continue these layers until the dish is full, having a layer of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2-16" id="Page_2-16">[Pg 2-16]</a></span>crackers on top. Place the dish in the oven and bake slowly until the
crackers are browned.</p>

<p><i>Mushroom Fritters.</i>&mdash;Take nice large tops, season, and dip into batter
and fry in hot butter as other fritters.</p>

<p><i>Mushrooms en ragout.</i>&mdash;Put into a stewpan a little "stock," a small
quantity of vinegar, parsley, and green onions chopped up, salt and
spices. When this is about to boil, the cleaned mushrooms are put in.
When done remove them from the fire and thicken with yolks of eggs.</p>

<p>The Lactarius <i>deliciosus</i> may be served with a white sauce or fried.
Badham says the best way to cook them is to season first with pepper,
salt, and small pieces of butter, and bake in a closely covered pie dish for
about three quarters of an hour.</p>

<p>The Cantharellus, being somewhat dry, requires more fluid sauce in
cooking than the juicier mushrooms, and is best minced and slowly
stewed until quite tender. Some advise soaking it in milk a few hours
before cooking. The Italians dry or pickle it or keep it in oil for winter
use.</p>

<p>Persoon gives the following recipes for cooking the Morel: 1st. Wash
and cleanse thoroughly, as the earth is apt to collect between the ridges;
dry and put them in a saucepan with pepper, salt, and parsley, adding or
not a piece of bacon; stew for an hour, pouring in occasionally a little
broth to prevent burning; when sufficiently done, bind with the yolks of
two or three eggs, and serve on buttered toast.</p>

<p>2. <i>Morelles à l'Italienne.</i>&mdash;Having washed and dried, divide them
across, put them on the fire with some parsley, scallion, chives, tarragon,
a little salt, and two spoonfuls of fine oil. Stew till the juice runs out,
then thicken with a little flour; serve with bread crumbs and a squeeze
of lemon.</p>

<p>Of late years France has found a formidable competitor in the culture
of mushrooms in Great Britain. The English market gardeners find their
moist, equable climate favorable to outdoor culture, and abundant crops
are grown by them in the open air, chiefly, however, for the home market.</p>

<p>That mushroom growing can be made a lucrative business is shown by
the experience of a well-known English grower, Mr. J. F. Barter, who on
one acre of ground has produced in the open air, without the aid of glass,
an average of from ten to twelve thousand pounds of mushrooms annually;
the price obtained for them varying according to the season, but
averaging ten pence, or twenty cents, per pound for the whole year. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2-17" id="Page_2-17">[Pg 2-17]</a></span>value of twelve thousand pounds of mushrooms at ten pence per pound
would be £500 sterling or $2,500.</p>

<p>For the purposes of comparison the following are quoted from the
Pall Mall Gazette, as exceptional prices realized in England for other
fruits and vegetables in recent years:</p>

<p>Pounds sterling per statute acre:</p>

<p>Very early gooseberries, 100; onions, 192; early lettuces, 100; plums,
100; potatoes, 100; strawberries, 150; black currants, 168; filberts, 200.</p>

<p>It will be seen that onions and filberts head the list, but the product of
an acre of mushrooms has been shown to be worth more than double that
of either filberts or onions.</p>

<p>In the localities specially favorable to hop growing 30 cwt. of hops to
the acre is considered exceptional, while the average price has been
quoted at 3 pounds sterling, or about one-fifth of the sum obtained from
Mr. Barter's acre of mushrooms. Three months in the year the weather
does not favor outdoor culture, and these months Mr. Barter spends in
manufacturing brick spawn, which he exports to this and other countries.
Among those who have been very successful in indoor culture are Mr.
William Robinson, editor of the "London Garden," and Mr. Horace Cox,
manager of the "Field."</p>

<p>In America, where mushroom culture is still comparatively in its
infancy, there have already been obtained very encouraging results by
painstaking growers. Most of the cultivation has been in the northern
and midwestern States, where the climatic conditions seemed most
favorable to indoor culture. A few figures as to the revenue obtained in
this way may be interesting to readers.</p>

<p>An experienced Pennsylvania grower states that from a total area of
5,500 square feet of beds, made up in two mushroom houses, he obtained
a crop of 5,000 pounds of mushrooms in one season, or about one pound
to the square foot. These sold at an average of a little over 50 cents per
pound. A third house, with 19,000 square feet of beds, produced 2,800
pounds, or one and one-half pounds to the square foot. This house
yielded a net profit of one thousand dollars. This, however, can be
quoted only as showing the possibilities of careful culture by experienced
growers under very favorable circumstances. Amateurs could scarcely
expect such good results. Three-fourths of a pound to the square foot
would probably come nearer the average. A Philadelphia grower gives
the average price secured from fifty shipments of mushrooms in one
season at 54 cents per pound. New York dealers report higher rates
than this. A Washington florist who utilizes the lower shelves of his
propagating houses for the purpose of mushroom growing informed me
that during two seasons he received 60 cents per pound wholesale, shipping
to New York, and that he sold one thousand dollars worth in one
season. Mr. Denton, a market gardener of Long Island, who cultivates
in houses built for the purpose, markets from 1,700 to 2,500 pounds per
year.</p>

<p>Thus far the market is in the hands of a comparatively few dealers in
the neighborhood of large cities, but there is certainly no good reason
why the growing of mushrooms should not be more generally undertaken
by the farming community. Certainly no one has better facilities than
are at the command of the enterprising American farmer. On most farms
the conditions are favorable or could easily be made so for mushroom culture,
on a moderate scale, at least. Generally there are disused sheds,
old barns, etc., which with a small outlay could be transformed into mushroom
houses, and where timber is plentiful the cost of building a small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2-18" id="Page_2-18">[Pg 2-18]</a></span>mushroom house would be repaid by the profits accruing from the business.</p>

<p>In the culture of mushrooms there are open, to the enterprising with
small capital, four sources of profit: first, the sale of the fresh mushrooms;
second, the manufacture of mushroom catsup; third, the canning
of the small button mushroom for exportation; and, fourth, the manufacture
of spawn.</p>

<p>It is well in this, as in all new industries, to begin in a small way, and
if success is attained it is easy to extend operations on a larger scale.
My advice to amateurs is to begin with one or two beds in a well-drained
cellar or shed where good ventilation and even temperature can be secured
at moderate cost. In the underground cellar economy is secured by the
saving in fuel. The beds can be made on the floor, flat, ridged or banked
against the wall, ten or twelve inches deep in a warm cellar, and from
fifteen to twenty inches in a cool cellar. The boxing for the sides and
ends may be built six or eight inches higher than the beds to give the
mushrooms plenty of head room.</p>


<h2><a name="PreparingCompost"></a>DIRECTIONS FOR PREPARING THE COMPOST FOR THE BEDS.</h2>

<p>Procure not less than a cartload of clean, fresh stable manure. Place
it under cover, to protect it from rain and drain water, mix well and heap
up the whole mass into a mound three feet high then beat the mound
firmly down to prevent undue heating. Repeat this operation every
other day until its rank smell is gone, taking care that on each turning
the outside dry manure is placed in the centre of the mound. By
this means the stable odor is dissipated while its heating properties
are equally distributed. Add to this from one-fourth to one-fifth of
clean, rich garden mould. Mix well. After this careful handling, the
mass may be considered fit for bedding purposes. When placed in
the beds the mass should be compacted again by beating with the back
of a spade or trowel. The bed surface should appear moist but
not wet, smooth and of firm consistence. From day to day it will be
necessary to test its general temperature by means of a thermometer.
To this end make at various places at different depths openings sufficiently
large to admit the use of a thermometer. It will be found that the
temperature is highest nearest the bottom. Test at various points. At
first the temperature will run high; 105° to 120° Fahrenheit is probably
as high as it will reach, but in a few days it will fall to 85° or 80° Fahrenheit.
At this point spawn the bed. For this purpose make holes in the
top of the bed about six inches apart and two inches deep with a blunt
dibble or broom handle. Place in these holes or openings a piece of
brick spawn about the size of a hen's egg, and cover the holes with manure;
finish by packing the same, keeping the surface of the bed smooth
and moist. The spawn should be slightly moistened before using.
Should the surface of the bed become dry, use water from a fine sprinkling
pan. The temperature of the cellar or house in which the bed may
be placed should range between 55° and 75°, and should not be lower
than 50°. If the spawn is good and all conditions attended to, the white
filaments should appear spreading through the bed within eight or ten
days after spawning. When the white spawn is observed on or near the
surface, cover the whole surface with from one to two inches of garden
loam well pulverized. A good general rule for spawning the bed is to
wait until the heat of the bed is on the decline and has fallen to at least
90° Fahrenheit. If the heat in the middle of the bed runs too high the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2-19" id="Page_2-19">[Pg 2-19]</a></span>spawn is killed. The experience of a number of growers has shown that
a bed spawned at 60° to 80° and kept at 55° after the mushrooms appear
gives better results than one spawned at 90°.</p>

<p>The quality of the manure makes some difference in its temperature.
That obtained from stables where horses are grass fed will be of lower
normal temperature and will chill quicker than that obtained from corn
or oat fed stock.</p>

<p>A solution of saltpeter in proportion of about fifteen grains to a quart
of water, occasionally spread over the bed with a fine hose, helps to accelerate
the growth of the mushrooms.</p>

<p>The proper condition of the manure as regards dryness or moistness
can be readily ascertained by squeezing it in the hand; it should be unctuous
enough to hold together in a lump, and so dry that you cannot
squeeze a drop of water out of it. Excessive moisture in the manure has
been often a cause of failure. It should be remembered also that when
the heat of the manure is on the decline it falls rapidly, five, often ten degrees
a day, till it reaches about 75°, and between that and 65° it may
rest for weeks.</p>

<p>One of the principal causes of the failure of mushroom culture in this
country is the use of old or poor spawn. Good spawn should have a
fresh, mushroomy odor, and a bluish-white appearance on the surface. In
buying spawn one should always go to reliable seedsmen.</p>


<h2><a name="Compost"></a><span class="smcap">Compost for Mushroom Beds.</span></h2>

<p>Sawdust has been used in England for mushroom beds, after having
been used for stable bedding, with very good results. It has also been
used successfully in the District of Columbia. In fact, the very large
models of cultivated mushrooms exhibited by the Division of Microscopy
of the Department of Agriculture at the World's Fair in Chicago were
moulded from mushrooms which were grown on the writer's premises, in
a composition of sawdust stable bedding, combined with about one-fourth
garden mould, but I am confident, at the same time, that much depends
on the kind of timber the sawdust is made from. In this case the sawdust
came from spruce.</p>


<h2><a name="Canada"></a><span class="smcap">Mushroom Culture in Canada.</span></h2>

<p>A Canadian correspondent informs me that he, with others, has been
very successful in growing mushrooms in the open air during the summer
months in Canada, and gives the following directions for preparing the
beds in the colder latitudes:</p>

<p>Place under a shed such amount of clean stable manure as may be required
for the beds, turning it over and over until all free ammonia has
escaped and the tendency of undue fermentation and evolution of high
temperature has greatly modified. To effect this, it is necessary to heap
up the manure each time in a mound, say three feet high after turning,
and beat it firmly down (the exclusion of free air prevents overheating).
To put the manure in proper condition for use in the beds, from two to
four weeks' treatment may be required, but much depends on the quality
of the manure and temperature of the atmosphere. Before making the
beds, and several days after the last turning, test the internal temperature
of the mound in the following manner: Make a hole with a broomstick
through the mound from top to bottom, and suspend a thermometer
half way down in the hole for, say, an hour. The temperature may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2-20" id="Page_2-20">[Pg 2-20]</a></span>be as high as 150° F. After the lapse of the time stated, beat the
mound more firmly down to prevent rise of temperature. Test again
two days after in the same manner. If the temperature has risen several
degrees the mound must be again taken down, turned over, and remade.
If, on the other hand, the temperature has fallen to 100° F., the permanent
bed may be made. If indoor growth is desired, such as a cellar, outbuilding,
or cave, the atmosphere must not fall below 50° F., nor be
over 80° F. Air drafts cannot be permitted. The floor must be dry and
the atmosphere moist. The cellar may be dark, or moderately light.
Growers differ in opinion in this respect. Growers generally add to
the manure about one-fourth or one-fifth garden soil, but success has
been attained without the use of garden soil, except as surface dressing
after spawning the bed; an excessive use of loam, in any case, tends to
lower the temperature too rapidly. Having prepared a box or frame-work
for the bed twelve inches deep, fill it up to within two inches of the top;
beat gently down with a board, or a brick, until it is even and compact.
On the following day make holes in the bed, with a dibble, ten inches
deep, in which suspend a thermometer half way down for an hour.
Should the temperature have fallen to 90° F., cover lightly with straw and
test on the following day. Should the temperature prove to be going
down, say to 80° F., or 85° F., it is safe to plant the spawn; but should
the temperature be on the rise, wait until it is falling. One grower has
stated that his greatest success has been when the spawn was planted at
the temperature of 75° F. Should the temperature fall too quickly and
the surface be too dry, sprinkle with water at blood heat, using a very
fine hose, and cover the bed with straw.</p>

<p>The spawn brick should be cut into pieces, about the size of an egg,
and planted in holes made in the bed, about two inches deep and about
six inches apart. The holes are then filled up and about two inches of
garden soil sifted over the surface of the bed. Tamp the bed surface
gently with the back of a spade. Mushrooms may be expected for table
use in about six or seven weeks, provided the spawn is good and the temperature
has not fallen below 50° F. In outdoor culture the beds must
be well covered with straw or canvas, and had better be under a shed
roof with southern exposure.</p>

<p>The spawn used by this grower is the "brick" spawn, imported from
Carter &amp; Holborn, London, England.</p>


<h2><a name="Japan"></a><span class="smcap">Cultivation of Mushrooms in Japan.</span></h2>

<p>The Japanese are very successful in cultivating a mushroom which they
call "Shiitake" or "Lepiota shiitake." China also produces the same
mushroom, but of an inferior quality. The Chinese therefore prefer the
mushroom cultivated by the Japanese, which they import from Japan in
large quantities. It is cultivated on a variety of trees, but is said to
grow best on the "Shiinoki," a species of oak (Quercus cuspidata).</p>

<p>There are three varieties of "Shiitake," the spring, summer, and
autumn crops differing somewhat in quality. The method of growing
the "Shiitake" is given by the Japanese Commissioner of Agriculture as
follows:</p>

<p>"Trees of from twenty to fifty years' growth are cut down at the approach
of winter when the sap has ceased to run, and after the lapse of
twenty or thirty days, according to the condition of the drying of the
wood, are sawed into logs of 4 or 5 feet in length. Into each of these
logs incisions are made with a hatchet, at intervals of about 6 inches, and
they are piled regularly upon a frame-work erected at a height of about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2-21" id="Page_2-21">[Pg 2-21]</a></span>1 foot above the ground, under the trees. The location of the ground
selected for piling the logs should be the slopes of a forest, facing southeast
or southwest. After keeping the logs as above described for from
two to three years, they are immersed in water for twenty-four hours in
the middle of November, and again laid one upon another for about four
days; if it is in a cold district, the pile is covered with straw or mats.
At the expiration of the fourth day the logs are obliquely tilted against
poles fixed horizontally to the trees at a height of about 4 feet in a well-ventilated
and sunny situation. The mushrooms soon appear in quantity,
and, after twenty or thirty days' growth, are ready for harvesting."</p>

<p>Recent reports of the Japanese Agricultural Department show the total
value of the annual export of "Shiitake" to be nearly five hundred thousand
"yen" (silver).</p>


<h2><a name="Spawn"></a><span class="smcap">Manufacture of Spawn.</span></h2>

<p>As many tons of artificial spawn are yearly imported into this country,
it would seem that the manufacture of spawn in the United States might
prove a profitable form of investment.</p>


<h3><a name="Brick"></a>"<span class="smcap">Brick Spawn.</span>"</h3>

<p>For commercial purposes the English method of making the spawn into
bricks has some advantages over the French "flake" process. Its compact
and uniform shape makes the brick more convenient for storage and
general handling, and greatly facilitates its transportation to long distances.
Brick spawn is made in the following manner: Clean horse droppings,
cow manure, loam, and road sweepings are beaten up in a mortar-like
consistency and then formed into bricks, moulds being used, slightly
differing in shape with different makers, but usually thinner and wider
than common building bricks. The following proportions are given: (1)
Horse droppings the chief part; one-fourth cow dung; remainder loam.
(2) Fresh horse droppings mixed with short litter for the greater part;
cow dung, one third; and the rest mould or loam. (3) Horse dung, cow
dung, and loam, in equal parts. When about half dry, depressions are
made in the bricks, sometimes in the centre, and sometimes in each corner,
and small pieces of good spawn are placed in these depressions, and plastered
over with the material of the brick. The cakes are then laid out to
dry, standing on their edges, and when nearly dry are piled in pairs with
the spawn-larded surfaces face to face. The bricks are then stacked
away, and covered with sweet fermenting litter, sufficiently to cause a heat
of 60° F. It should not be over 70° F. One spawn manufacturer says
that the most rapid and successful growth of the mycelium is attained
when the temperature is from 63° F. to 67° F. The bricks are examined
frequently during the process, and when the mycelium of the old spawn
has permeated the whole mass like a fine white mould, the bricks are taken
out and dried in a well-ventilated dark place. They are then placed in a
cool, dark storehouse, where they are not subject to dampness and where
the temperature is about 50° F., not over 65° or below 35° F. Slight ventilation
is necessary, but not enough to make the bricks dust-dry. Keeping
the spawn dry merely suspends its growth; as soon as it is again
submitted to favorable conditions of moisture and heat, its pristine activity
returns. Dampness, combined with heat, stimulates the growth of mycelium;
frost also destroys the vitality of the spawn. It is evident, therefore,
that these conditions should not exist in the store-room.</p>

<p>One manufacturer advocates piling the bricks, after spawning, on a clay
floor, packing closely four bricks deep, and covering them with sifted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2-22" id="Page_2-22">[Pg 2-22]</a></span>loam. By this method it is claimed that danger of "fire fang" will be
avoided, as the bricks will be kept at a perfectly uniform temperature of
about 60° or 66°, which causes the spawn to run quickly and uniformly.
In from four to six weeks they are ready to take out and dry for use or
storage.</p>

<p>The French or "Flake" spawn comes in light masses of loose, dry
litter. It is obtained in the following way: A bed is made up as if for
mushrooms in the ordinary way, and spawned with "virgin" spawn, and
when the bed is thoroughly impregnated with spawn, it is broken up and
set aside to dry. This spawn is usually sold in small boxes, containing
from two to five pounds, but it also can be obtained in bulk when it is
purchased by weight. The French or "flake" spawn is much more expensive
than the English or "brick" spawn. It is claimed by some very
successful growers, who have tried both, that the brick spawn produces
heavier and fleshier mushrooms than the French "flake."</p>


<h3><a name="MillTrack"></a><span class="smcap">"Mill Track" Spawn.</span></h3>

<p>"Mill track" spawn was formerly considered the best in England, but
since horse power has given place to steam power in the mills there is
now no further supply of mill track, and it is practically superseded by
the "brick" spawn. The real "mill track" is the natural spawn that
has spread through the thoroughly amalgamated horse droppings in mill
tracks, or the sweepings from mill tracks.</p>


<h3><a name="Heap"></a><span class="smcap">Spawn Produced in a Manure Heap.</span></h3>

<p>During the past year I have made some experiments in the pine and
oak woods of Hynesboro' Park, Maryland, with relation to spawn culture,
an account of which may prove of interest to students in this line of investigation.
Several loads of stable manure and oak-leaf bedding were
well mixed and formed into a mound about three feet in height, having a
diameter of six feet, and tapering to about four inches in depth at the
outer edge. The mass was quite moist and slightly tamped to give it
general consistency. It was exposed to the open air, without protection,
during the months of September, October, and November. In the meantime,
frequent rains occurred. On examination it was found that the rains
did not penetrate to a depth of more than four inches. On opening up
the centre of the mound, it was observed that the portion thus exposed
consisted of highly decomposed leaves, and presented a white mass of
matted, "burned" mycelium. It was evident that the temperature at
that point had risen considerably above 100° Fahr. The mycelium was,
doubtless, produced in abundance before the temperature reached 100
Fahr. and became scorched as the temperature increased. On examining
the outer edges, where the depth was only twelve inches, I found an
abundance of mycelium which did not show any appearance of having
been scorched by undue temperature. Since no mycelium had been
added to the mound, it is evident that the spores which produced it must
have been present, although unobserved, and awaiting only the proper
conditions for development, <i>i. e.</i>, for budding and the production of mycelium.
At the end of the third month, groups of the common meadow
mushroom, Agaricus campestris, together with some fine examples of
Tricholoma terreum, an edible mushroom, common to these woods, appeared
on the edges of the mound.</p>

characteristic of certain species of mushrooms, together with the cortina
or veil of which the ring, if present, is the remnant, in some species, either
as it appears entire or as a fringe on the margin of the cap, contrasting
these forms with a sectional view of a species in which the veil or ring
is always wanting.</p>

<p><i>Subgenus Hypholoma</i>. Hymenophore continuous with the stem, veil
woven into a fugacious web, which adheres to the margin of the pileus.
Gills adnate or sinuate; spores brownish purple, sometimes intense purple,
almost black.&mdash;M. C. Cooke.</p>

<p>This subgenus has been divided into the following five groups:</p>
<ol>

<li>Fasciculares.&mdash;Pileus smooth, tough, bright colored when dry, not
hygrophanous. Examples, Ag. (Hypholoma) <i>sublateritius</i> and Ag.
(Hypholoma) <i>fascicularis</i>.</li>

<li>Viscidi.&mdash;Pileus naked, viscid. Example, Ag. (Hypholoma) <i>&oelig;dipus</i>.</li>

<li>Velutini.&mdash;Pileus silky, with innate fibrils. Example, Ag. (Hypholoma)
<i>velutinus</i>.</li>

<li>Flocculosi.&mdash;Pileus clad with floccose superficial evanescent scales.
Example, Ag. (Hypholoma) <i>cascus</i>.</li>

<li>Appendiculati.&mdash;Pileus smooth and hygrophanous. Example, Ag.
(Hypholoma) <i>Candollianus</i>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The species are not numerous. They are generally either gregarious
or cæspitose, and are often found in clusters upon tree stumps, or springing
from the buried roots of stumps. A few species are found in short
grass in open places; but few are recorded as edible, and one, H. <i>fascicularis</i>,
has been classed as deleterious by Berkeley, Cooke, and some of
the earlier authors. I find, however, no authenticated case of poisoning
by this species, and, indeed, have as yet found no species of Hypholoma
which could be satisfactorily identified as H. fascicularis.</p>

<p>The few species of Hypholoma which I have tested have been palatable,
and one or two are of very delicate flavor.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Ag. (Hypholoma) sublateritius</b> Schaeff. "<i>Red Tuft</i>." (<b>Hypholoma sublateritium</b>)
"<i>The Brick Top</i>."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Edible.</span></p>

<p>The cap of this species is fleshy and obtuse, convexo-plane, sometimes
showing a superficial whitish cloudiness upon the margin coming from
the veil, which soon disappears, leaving it smooth and dry; color tawny
brick red, with pale straw margin; flesh compact and whitish, turning
yellow when wilted. Stem stuffed and fibrillose, tapering downward.
Near its attachment to the cap the color is very light yellow; lower down
and towards the root it is covered with patches and lines of burnt sienna
color. It bears no distinct ring. In very young plants the filmy veil is
sometimes perceived, reaching from the margin of the cap to the stem.
This disappears as the cap expands, sometimes leaving the stem obscurely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3-4" id="Page_3-4">[Pg 3-4]</a></span>annulate. Gills adnate in full-grown specimens, slightly decurrent, somewhat
crowded, dingy white or cinereous, turning to dark olive, never yellow;
in old or wilted specimens changing to a dark brown. In old specimens
the cap is a reddish brown and the gills are sometimes stained
with the purplish brown of the spores.</p>

<p>This is a very common species and very abundant in pine and oak woods.
I have seen an oak stump in Prince George's County, Md., measuring
from 3 to 4 feet in height, literally covered with mushrooms of this species.
This mushroom has been recorded as suspicious by some writers, probably
owing to its slightly bitter taste, but I have thoroughly tested its
edible qualities, both uncooked and prepared in various ways for the table,
using the caps only. It keeps well when dried, and when ground into
powder, with the addition of boiling water and a little pepper and salt,
makes a very pleasant and nutritious beverage. It is most abundant in
the early autumn, and is gathered in this latitude well into the winter,
even when the snow is on the ground.</p>

<p>Our American plant is less heavy and more graceful in aspect than the
same species in England, as figured in English works, but the general
characteristics are the same.</p>

<p>Ag. (Hypholoma) <i>fascicularis</i> Hudson, recorded as deleterious, is figured
in "Cooke's Illustrations."</p>

<p>Dr. Berkeley thus distinguishes these two species from each other. Cap
of <i>sublateritius</i> is obtuse, discoid; that of <i>fascicularis</i>, subumbonate.
Flesh of the former, compact, dingy-white; that of the latter, yellow.
Stem in <i>sublateritius</i> is "stuffed," attenuated downwards, ferruginous;
stem of <i>fascicularis</i> hollow, thin, flexuose. The gills in both species are
adnate, crowded; but in <i>fascicularis</i> they are also linear and deliquescent,
and are <i>yellow</i> in color.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>.&mdash;In the Friesian arrangement of the genera of the order Agaricini,
which is adopted by M. C. Cooke, Hypholoma finds place as a subgenus
of the genus Agaricus, spore series Pratelli. Saccardo in his Sylloge
elevates Hypholoma to the rank of a separate genus and places it in
his spore series Melanosporæ.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate IX.</span></p>

<p class="center"><b>Agaricus (Hypholoma) incertus</b> Peck. (<i>Hypholoma incertum</i>.)</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Edible.</span></p>

<p>Cap fleshy but fragile, smooth and hygrophanous, moist; at first convex,
then expanding; color creamy white. Gills adnate, narrow, crowded,
whitish in young specimens, turning to a pinkish dun color, later to a
rosy cinnamon, sometimes showing when mature a slightly purplish tint.
Stem smooth, slender, long and hollow, with slight striations near the
apex, white. Specimens occur in which the stem is obscurely annulate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3-5" id="Page_3-5">[Pg 3-5]</a></span>arising from the attachment to it of fragments of the veil, but usually it is
ringless.</p>

<p>The typical species of Hypholoma have the fleshy part of the cap confluent
with the stem, but in H. <i>incertum</i> the stem is not confluent and is
easily separated from the cap as in the Lepiotas. This mushroom was
first recorded by Peck in his early reports as the variety "<i>incertus</i>" of
the species Agaricus (Hypholoma) Candollianus, but has since been recorded
by Saccardo as a distinct species, Hypholoma incertum.</p>

<p>Two species of Hypholoma have the same habit and sufficiently resemble
<i>incertum</i> to be taken for it, if not carefully examined as to points of
difference. These are H. <i>Candollianum</i>, named in honor of A. De Candolle,
and H. <i>appendiculatum</i>. In the first named of these two species
the cap is whitish, the gills at first violet in color, changing to dark cinnamon
brown. In H. appendiculatum the pileus is rugose when dry, and
sprinkled with atoms. It is darker in color than that of H. incertum;
Cooke says tawny or pale ochre; Massee says bay, then tawny. The
gills are sub-adnate, in color resembling those of H. incertum; stem
slender, smooth, and white.</p>

<p>From the foregoing it will be seen that H. <i>incertum</i> agrees more nearly
with H. <i>Candollianum</i> in the color of the cap, but more nearly with H.
<i>appendiculatum</i> in the color of the gills. Saccardo recognizes the three
as "distinct species of the <i>genus Hypholoma</i>." As all are edible, the
slight differences observed are interesting chiefly to the mycologist. The
mycophagist will find them equally valuable from a gastronomic point of
view. In taste they resemble the common mushroom. They are more
fragile, however, and require less cooking than the cultivated mushroom.
Broiled on toast or cooked for ten minutes in a chafing dish, they make a
very acceptable addition to the lunch menu.</p>

<p>The specimens figured in <a href="#PLATE_IX">Plate IX</a> were selected from a crop of thirty
or more growing in the author's garden, in very rich soil at the base of a
plum-tree stump. For several seasons past small crops have been gathered
from the same spot, as well as around the base of a flourishing peach
tree. Quantities of all three species have been gathered in the short grass
of the Capitol grounds for a number of seasons, and in the various parks
of the District of Columbia. Specimens have been received from western
New York and Massachusetts. Those growing upon soil very heavily
fertilized are apt to be somewhat stouter and shorter stemmed than
those coming up through the short grass in the parks.</p>

<p>In the Friesian classification which, with modifications, has prevailed
for many years among mycologists, the <i>genus Agaricus</i> included in its
<i>subgenera</i> the greater part of the species of the order <i>Agaricini</i>. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3-8" id="Page_3-8">[Pg 3-8]</a></span>subgenera, printed in the above table in italics, were included in this
genus. The genera are printed in capitals. In the Saccardian system,
all the <i>subgenera</i> of <i>Agaricus</i> having been elevated to <i>generic</i> rank, the
term Agaricus is limited to a very small group which includes the <i>subgenus
Psalliota</i> of Fries, the species being characterized by fleshy caps,
free gills, ringed stem, and dark brown or purplish brown spores. As
restricted, it naturally falls into the spore series <i>Melanosporeæ.</i></p>

<p>In the white-spored section, Leucospori, the recorded edible species
occur in the following genera: Marasmius, Cantharellus, Lactarius,
Russula, Hygrophorus, Collybia, Pleurotus, Clitocybe, Tricholoma,
Armillaria, Lepiota, and Amanita. The plants of Marasmius are usually
thin and dry, reviving with moisture. Cantharellus is characterized by
the obtuseness of the edges of the lamellæ, Lactarius by the copious
milky or sticky fluid which exudes from the plants when cut or bruised.
Russula is closely allied to Lactarius, and the plants bear some resemblance
in external appearance to those of that genus, but they are
never milky, and the gills are usually rigid and brittle. In Hygrophorus
the plants are moist, not very large, often bright colored, and the gills
have a waxy appearance. The Collybias are usually cæspitose, the stems
exteriorly cartilaginous, in some species swelling and splitting open in
the centre.</p>

<p>In Pleurotus the stem is lateral or absent. The plants are epiphytal,
usually springing from the decaying bark of trees and old stumps.</p>

<p>In Clitocybe the plants are characterized by a deeply depressed, often
narrow cap, with the gills acutely adnate, or running far down the stem,
which is elastic, with a fibrous outer coat covered with minute fibers.
Many of the species have a fragrant odor. The Tricholomas are stout
and fleshy, somewhat resembling the Russulas, but distinguished from
them by the sinuate character of the gills, which show a slight notched
or toothed depression just before reaching the stem (represented in Fig.
4, <a href="#PLATE_IV">Plate IV</a>). Typical species of Armillaria show a well-defined ring and
scales upon the stem, the remains of the partial veil, and the plants
are usually large, and cæspitose. The Lepiotas are recognized by the
soft, thready character of the fleshy portion of the cap, and the fringed
scales formed by the breaking of the cuticle. The ease with which the
ringed stem is removed from its socket in the cap is another characteristic
which distinguishes the plants from those of other genera.</p>

<p>The Amanitas are distinguished by the volva, which sheathes the
somewhat bulbous stem at its base and the ring and veil which in the
young plant are very distinct features, the whole plant in embryo being
enveloped in the volva.</p>

<p>The Amanita group, besides containing some very good edible species,
is also credited with containing the most dangerous species of all the
mushroom family, and some which are undoubtedly fatal in their effects.<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_2" id="Footnote_A_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_2"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> A more detailed description of this group will appear in No. 5 of this series.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3-9" id="Page_3-9">[Pg 3-9]</a></span></p><p>The Nyctali are minute mushrooms parasitic on other mushrooms.</p>

<p>In Omphalia, the plants are quite small, with membranaceous caps,
gills truly decurrent, and cartilaginous stems.</p>

<p>The Myceneæ are generally very small, slender, and fragile, usually
cæspitose, with bell-shaped caps, sinuate gills, not decurrent, and cartilaginous
stems. In some species the plants exude a milky juice.</p>

<p>In the genera Panus, Lentinus, Lenzites, Schizophyllum, Xerotus, and
Trogia, the plants are leathery or coriaceous, dry and tough, and though
none are recorded as poisonous, they are too tough to be edible.</p>

<p>The mushrooms having pink or salmon colored spores, section Rhodosporii,
form the smallest of the four primary groups of Agaricini, the
number of known species not exceeding 400, and most of these are tasteless,
or of disagreeable odor, while some are recorded as unwholesome.</p>

<p>The species are pink-gilled when mature, though often white or whitish
when very young.</p>

<p>The recorded edible species are found in Volvaria, Clitopilus, and
Pluteus. The Volvariæ are characterized by the very large and perfect
volva which wraps the base of the stem in loose folds, the ringless stem,
and the pink, soft, liquescent gills, which are free and rounded behind.
The cap is not warted; in some species it is viscid, and in <i>bombycinus</i>,
recorded by several authors as edible, and by some as doubtful, it is covered
with a silky down.</p>

<p>In Clitopilus the odor of the edible species is more or less mealy. The
cap is fleshy, and the margin at first involute. Two edible species which
closely resemble each other&mdash;viz., Clitopilus <i>prunulus</i>, "Plum mushroom,"
and Clitopilus <i>orcella</i>, "Sweetbread mushroom,"&mdash;are highly recommended
for their delicacy of flavor.</p>

<p>In Leptonia most of the species are small, thin, and brittle, corresponding
with Mycena in the white-spored series, and with Psathyra and
Psathyrella in the dark-spored series.</p>

<p>Eccilia corresponds with Omphalia. Claudopus corresponds with
Pleurotus in its habit of growth and lateral stem, differing in the color
of the spores.</p>

<p>Annularia includes only a few small species having a ringed stem, no
volva, and free pink gills. Cooke says of this subgenus that no British
species are known.</p>

<p>The recorded species of Pluteus have their habitat on tree stumps,
sawdust, or upon fallen timber. One species, Pluteus <i>cervinus</i>, is recorded
as edible, but not specially commended. Of Entoloma, Worthington
Smith says, "It is allied to Tricholoma, though most of the species are
thinner and often brittle. It agrees also in structure with Hebeloma and
Hypholoma." None of the species are recorded as having value as esculents.</p>

<p>The genus Bolbitius is described by Cooke as a small genus intermediate
between Agaricus and Coprinus on the one side, and Coprinus
and Cortinarius on the other. The species are small and ephemeral.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3-10" id="Page_3-10">[Pg 3-10]</a></span>Saccardo places Bolbitius in his division Melanosporæ, although the
spores are ochraceous.</p>

<p>In the section Pratelli Psalliota and Hypholoma contain mushrooms
which are of exceptionally fine flavor. In the first of these is found
the common field mushroom Agaricus campester and its allies.</p>

<p>The black-spored section Coprinarii contains two genera which include
a few recorded edible species, viz., Coprinus and Gomphidius. The Psathyrellas
correspond in size to the Mycenas in the white-spored series
and to the Psathyras in the purple-spored section; the gills are free or
adnate and turn black when mature. None of the species are edible.</p>

<p>In Paneolus the plants are somewhat viscid when moist, the gills are
described as "clouded, never becoming purple or brown." They are
usually found on manure heaps near cities. None are edible.</p>

<p>Saccardo in his Sylloge combines the Pratellæ and Coprinarii, making
of them one section which he calls <i>Melanosporeæ</i>.</p>

<p>G. Massee, the British mycologist, makes of the black-spored and the
purple and purplish-brown spored series two divisions, calling them, respectively,
<i>Porphyrosporeæ</i> and <i>Melanosporeæ</i>.</p>

<p>The recorded edible species of the spore section Dermini are found
in Pholiota, Cortinarius, and Paxillus. The larger proportion of the
Pholiotas grow upon tree stumps. They have a fugacious, persistent
friable ring, and are liable to be confused with the Cortinarii, unless attention
is paid to the spidery veil and the iron-rust tint of the spores of
the latter. Only a few of the species are recorded as edible, but none
are known to be poisonous. Cortinarius is a large genus. It contains a
larger proportion of edible species than Pholiota, and none are recorded
as poisonous. The cobweb-like veil which extends from stem to margin
of cap in the young species, and the rust-colored spores which dust the
gills as the species mature, distinguish the genus from all others.</p>

<p>A characteristic feature of Paxillus, and one which makes it easily distinguishable
from others of the same group, is the ease with which the
gills as a whole can be separated from the substance or fleshy portion of
the cap. There is an exception to this in the species Paxillus involutus,
recorded by Peck as edible.</p>

<h1><a name="Polyporei"></a>POLYPOREI.</h1>


<p>Hymenium lining the cavity of tubes or pores which are sometimes
broken up into teeth or concentric plates.&mdash;Berkeley's Outlines.</p>

<p>The plants of this second primary group or order of the family Hymenomycetes
exhibit a greater dissimilarity of form and texture than do
those of the Agaricini. Some of its genera consist almost wholly of
coriaceous or woody plants. A few contain fleshy ones. Some of the
species have a distinct stem, while others are stemless. With regard to the
receptacle in the plants of the genera <i>Boletus</i>, <i>Strobilomyces</i>, etc., it forms
a perfect cap, like that of the common Agaric, a cushion of tubes taking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3-11" id="Page_3-11">[Pg 3-11]</a></span>the place of gills on the under surface of the cap, the hymenium in this
case lining the inner surface of the tubes from which the spores drop
when mature.</p>

<p>In some species, such as those of the genus Poria, the receptacle is
reduced to a single thin fibrous stratum, adhering closely to the matrix
and exposing a surface of crowded pores, and in others it consists of
fibrous strata formed in concentric layers.</p>

<p>A number of groups, each of which was treated in the original Friesian
classification as a single genus, have more recently been recognized as
comprising several distinct genera. In the Saccardian system the genera
Trametes, Dædalea, Merulius, Porothelium, and Fistulina still retain the
generic rank assigned to them by Fries, but the old genus Boletus is
subdivided into four genera, Boletus, Strobilomyces, Boletinus, and
Gyrodon, while Polyporus, originally a very large genus, is subdivided
into the genera Polyporus, Fomes, Polystictus, and Poria. This arrangement
was in part suggested by Fries in his later works, and is accepted
by M. C. Cooke, as indicated in his latest work on fungi.</p>

<p>Quoting M. C. Cooke, "<i>Strobilomyces</i> is <i>Boletus</i> with a rough warty
and scaly pileus; <i>Boletinus</i> is <i>Boletus</i> with short, large radiating
pores; and <i>Gyrodon</i> is <i>Boletus</i> with elongated sinuate irregular pores,
all fleshy, firm fungi of robust habit, possessing stem and cap." The
species of the genus Polyporus as now restricted are somewhat fleshy
in the young stage, shrinking as they mature and dry, and becoming indurated
with age. In Fomes the species, of woody consistency from the
first, have no room for shrinkage, and are quite rigid; the tubes being in
strata, and the strata growing yearly, the species are virtually perennial.
The pileus of the plant shows a rigid polished crust resulting from resinous
exudations.</p>

<p>In Polystictus the plants are usually small, thin, tough, and irregular
in outline, the tubes exceedingly short, with thin walls, which easily split
up, giving the pores at times a toothed or fringed appearance. The surface
is velvety, or hairy, and zoned in varying colors. They are very common
upon decaying tree stumps, often covering the surface of the stump in
gaily colored layers. Not esculent.</p>

<p>Poria is composed of resupinate species with the pores normally in a
single series, the whole stratum spread over, and adhering to the matrix.
The species are coriaceous or woody. Not esculent.</p>

<p>The plants of the genus Trametes allied to Fomes are epiphytal, with
the trama the same in substance and color as the hymenophore. The
tubes do not form in regular strata, but are sunk into the substance of
the pileus. The plants are coriaceous, and none are edible.</p>

<p>Dædalea closely resembles <i>Trametes</i> with the tubes forming deep labyrinthiform
depressions. Whole plant woody, sessile.</p>

<p>Hexagonia, allied by its characteristics to Polystictus, has large hexagonal
pores, with firm, entire dissepiments.</p>

<p>In Favolus the plants are slightly fleshy and substipitate with the
pores angular, and radiating from the stem. Not edible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3-12" id="Page_3-12">[Pg 3-12]</a></span></p><p>The species of the genus Laschia are recognized by the shallow irregular
pores and the vein like character of their dissepiments (or pore walls).
Substance slightly gelatinous.</p>

<p>In the plants of Porothelium, irregular papillæ take the place of tubes,
and the plants are sub-membranaceous and resupinate, having the habit
of those of Poria.</p>

<p>The genus Merulius has been termed the lowest and most imperfect of
the genera of Polyporei. It presents a soft, waxy spore-bearing surface,
reticulated with obtuse folds. Solenia, by early authors placed in Discomycetes,
thence transferred to Auricularini, and by some authors associated
with Cyphella in Theleporei, now finds place as one of the genera
of Polyporei as given by Saccardo.</p>

<p>The above-mentioned genera, together with Myriadoporus, Ceriomyces,
Bresadolia, Theleporus, Gl&oelig;porus, and Cyclomyces, constitute the Polyporeæ
of the Saccardian system.</p>

<p><i>Myriadoporus</i> is a North American genus. It is a form of the genus
Polyporus, but with pores in the <i>interior</i> as well as on the <i>exterior</i> surface.
<i>Ceriomyces</i> is generally regarded as a spurious genus. It is similar
to <i>Myriadoporus</i>, but with internal pores and only spurious pores
externally. Of <i>Bresadolia</i> Cooke says "there is only one described
species, and of this only one specimen has been found." <i>Theleporus</i> is
an African genus of which only one species is known. <i>Gl&oelig;porus</i> is a
form of resupinate Polyporus, except that the hymenium or pore-bearing
surface is gelatinous instead of being firm. <i>Cyclomyces</i> is a
genus with some features of Lenzites; it is leathery. All of these are
more or less coriaceous. None are edible. <i>Campbellia</i> is a new genus.
It is <i>Merulius</i> with a pileus and central stem.</p>

<p>The edible Polyporeæ are found in the genera Boletus, Strobilomyces,
Gyrodon, Boletinus, Polyporus, and Fistulina. Of these, the first four
genera contain most of the edible species as well as a few which have been
regarded as unwholesome or poisonous.</p>

<p>In the genus Polyporus as now restricted, the species Polyporus <i>sulphureus</i>
Fries is perhaps the one most likely to be selected for table use,
the others becoming very quickly indurated or tough, and this should be
gathered when very young, as in maturity it loses its fleshy consistency
and becomes dry and tough. It is common on old tree stumps and is
often found on the dead wood of living trees, the bright yellow and
vivid orange red tints which characterize the young plant making it
very conspicuous.</p>

<p>It is easily recognized by its irregular, closely overlapping frond-like
caps, white flesh, and the very small sulphur-yellow tubes. The spores
are white, elliptical. The flesh of young specimens is somewhat juicy.</p>

<p>The geographical distribution is wide, and in places where a moist,
warm temperature prevails plants of this species often attain very large
proportions, sometimes completely encircling the trunk of a tree at its
base. The bright colors fade as the plant matures, and the plant becomes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3-13" id="Page_3-13">[Pg 3-13]</a></span>indurated and friable, when very old crumbling readily in the
hands.</p>

<p>To prepare for the table, very thin slices of young specimens should be
cut and either allowed to slowly simmer on the back of the range, or soaked
in milk and then fried in butter.</p>

<p>Of the genus Fistulina but one species, Fistulina hepatica, figured in
Plate X, is recorded as edible and indigenous to this country.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Fistulina hepatica</b> Bull. "<i>Beefsteak Mushroom</i>," "<i>Liver Fungus</i>."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Edible.</span></p>

<p><i>Genus Fistulina</i> Bull. Hymenophore fleshy, hymenium inferior, that
is, on the under surface of the cap, at first papillose; the papillæ at
length elongated, and forming distinct tubes.</p>

<p>Besides Fistulina <i>hepatica</i>, five species of this genus are recorded in
Saccardo's Sylloge, viz., F. <i>radicata</i> Schw., F. <i>spathulata</i> B. &amp; C., F. <i>pallida</i>
B. &amp; R., F. <i>rosea</i> Mont., and F. <i>antarctica</i> Speg.; the last indigenous
to Patagonia.</p>

<p>F. <i>hepatica</i> is the only species with which I am familiar. The plants
of this species are very irregular in form, rootless, epiphytal, often stemless,
and sometimes attached to the matrix by a very short stem. This
fungus is frequently found upon old oak, chestnut, and ash trees, developing
in the rotting bark. It appears first as a rosy pimple, or in a series
of red granules. In a very short time it becomes tongue-shaped, sometimes
kidney shaped, assuming the color of a beet root. As it increases
in size it changes form again, becoming broad in proportion to its length,
and changing in color to a deep blood red, and finally to a dull liver tint.
Its lower surface is often paler than its upper, it being tinged with yellow
and pinkish hues.</p>

<p>One author states that it requires about two weeks to attain its highest
development, after which it gradually decays.</p>

<p>It varies in size from a few inches to several feet in circumference.
Rev. M. J. Berkeley mentions one which weighed thirty pounds. It has
been styled, the "<i>poor man's fungus</i>," and in flavor resembles meat more
than any other.</p>

<p>The substance is fleshy and juicy in the early stage. The pileus is
papillose, the papillæ elongated, and forming distinct tubes as the pileus
expands. These tubes are separable from each other, and with age become
approximate and jagged at their orifices. The tubes are at first
yellowish, with a pink tinge, becoming dingy with age. The fleshy substance,
or hymenophore, is often veined in light and dark red streaks.
The juice is pellucid, red, and slightly acid. Spores at first nearly round,
becoming elliptical, salmon color.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3-14" id="Page_3-14">[Pg 3-14]</a></span></p><p>This fungus is esteemed in Europe, where it is eaten prepared in a variety
of ways.</p>

<p>When young and tender it can be sliced and broiled or minced and
stewed, making a delicious dish. When too old the stock is rather tough
for good eating, but the gravy taken from it forms a rich flavoring for a
vegetable stew or a meat ragout. The following recipe for cooking this
mushroom has been recommended:</p>

<blockquote><p>Slice and macerate it, add pepper and salt, a little lemon, and chopped onions or
garlic; then strain and boil the liquid, which makes most excellent gravy, resembling
that of good beefsteak.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Fistulina hepatica is well known in Europe, and is found in different
parts of the United States, in some places growing abundantly. I
have gathered some fine specimens in Maryland and Virginia, but none
as large as that described by Dr. Berkeley.</p>

<h1><a name="Recipes"></a>RECIPES FOR COOKING MUSHROOMS.</h1>


<p><i>To Pot Mushrooms.</i>&mdash;The small open mushrooms suit best for potting.
Trim and rub them; put into a stewpan a quart of mushrooms, 3 ounces
of butter, 2 teaspoonfuls of salt, and half a teaspoonful of cayenne and
mace, mixed, and stew for ten or fifteen minutes, or till the mushrooms
are tender; take them carefully out and drain them perfectly on a sloping
dish, and when cold press them into small pots and pour clarified butter
over them, in which state they will keep for a week or two. Writing-paper
placed over the butter, and over that melted suet, will effectually
preserve them for weeks in a dry, cool place.</p>

<p><i>To Pickle Mushrooms.</i>&mdash;Select a number of sound, small pasture mushrooms,
as nearly alike as possible in size. Throw them for a few minutes
into cold water, then drain them, cut off the stalks, and gently rub off
the outer skin with a moist flannel dipped in salt; then boil the vinegar,
adding to each quart two ounces of salt, half a nutmeg grated, a dram of
mace, and an ounce of white pepper corns. Put the mushrooms into the
vinegar for ten minutes over the fire; then pour the whole into small
jars, taking care that the spices are equally divided; let them stand a day,
then cover them.</p>

<p><i>Baked Mushrooms.</i>&mdash;Peel the tops of twenty mushrooms; cut off a
portion of the stalks and wipe them carefully with a piece of flannel
dipped in salt. Lay the mushrooms in a tin dish, put a small piece of
butter on the top of each, and season with pepper and salt. Set the dish
in the oven and bake them from twenty minutes to half an hour. When
done, arrange them high in the centre of a very hot dish, pour the sauce
around them, and serve quickly and as hot as you possibly can.</p>

<p><i>Mushrooms with Bacon.</i>&mdash;Take some full-grown mushrooms, and,
having cleaned them, procure a few rashers of nice streaky bacon and fry
them in the usual manner. When nearly done add a dozen or so of mushrooms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3-15" id="Page_3-15">[Pg 3-15]</a></span>and fry them slowly until they are cooked. In this process they
will absorb all the fat of the bacon, and with the addition of a little salt
and pepper will form a most appetizing breakfast relish.</p>

<p><i>Mushroom Pie.</i>&mdash;A very good mushroom pie is made in the following
manner: Chop a quart of mushrooms into small pieces, season to taste,
and add one pound of round steak chopped fine and seasoned with a
small piece of onion. If the steak is lean, add a small piece of suet, unless
butter is preferred to give flavor. Put the chopped steak and mushrooms
in deep saucepan with cover, and stew slowly until tender. Make
a crust as for beefsteak pie and put in a deep earthern dish, lightly browning
the under crust before adding the stew, and cover with a crust lightly
punctured.</p>

<p>In some parts of Russia mushrooms form an important part of the
diet of the people, especially during the Lenten season, when the fast of the
Greek church is very strictly kept, and meat, fish, eggs, and butter are
forbidden.</p>

<p>Provision is made for this season in the securing of quantities of dried
and salted mushrooms, which are cut up in strips and made into salads
with a dressing of olive oil and vinegar. The poorer classes to whom
the olive oil is unattainable use the rape seed and other vegetable oils in
the cooking of their mushrooms.</p>

<p>The following recipes are translated from a recently published Russian
work on the subject of mushrooms, cultivated and wild:</p>

<p>Select fresh, sound Boleti, cut off the caps, and, after wiping clean with
a napkin, place them in a sieve, pouring over them scalding water; when
thoroughly drained, leave them where there is a free current of air until
perfectly dry. Next string them upon stout twine, leaving spaces between
to allow of free circulation of air. If convenient, they can be dried
artificially by placing in a not too hot oven with the door open. Dried
by either method, they can be kept all winter. Before using, they should
be soaked in water or milk until soft. In this condition they make very
good flavoring for soup or gravy, and can also be used as filling for pies.</p>

<p><i>Mushrooms Cooked in Butter.</i>&mdash;Wipe the mushrooms clean and dip in
dry flour. Heat a quantity of butter to boiling temperature in a saucepan,
seasoning with a small piece of onion. Drop the flour-covered
mushrooms into the boiling butter, shaking the pan constantly over the
fire. When the mushrooms are cooked add sour cream to taste. Before
serving, sprinkle with grated muscat nut.</p>

<p><i>Mushroom Pickle.</i>&mdash;Select only young button mushrooms. Put them
for a few moments in boiling water lightly salted and vinegared. Boil
vinegar (only the best should be used), spicing it according to taste. Allow
the vinegar to cool. Put the mushrooms in layers in a jar and pour
over them enough spiced vinegar to cover. Seal tightly.</p>

<p><i>Salted Piperites.</i>&mdash;Only the caps are taken of the Lactarius piperites.
They are placed first in salted scalding water for several minutes. The
water is then gently pressed out with a napkin, the mushrooms are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3-16" id="Page_3-16">[Pg 3-16]</a></span>placed on sieves and cold water poured over them. They are then placed
in layers in a jar, each layer sprinkled with salt, and whole pepper and
minced onion scattered over the layer. When the jar is full a thin round
board is placed upon the top layer and pressed down with weights, and
as the mass gives way mushrooms are added until the jar is compactly
filled. The jar is then covered with parchment or otherwise tightly sealed.
Eight gallons of mushrooms require from one to one and a half glasses
of salt. This makes a good salad when treated with oil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;L. piperites is an extremely acrid mushroom when in the raw
state, and the Russians do not stew it, but prepare it in the above way,
taking the precaution to scald thoroughly with salted water before putting
away. The precaution of scalding through several waters is a wise one
to use in the preparation of all mushrooms inasmuch as the poisonous
principle of most mushrooms is soluble in scalding water. Dilute vinegar
is frequently used in the same manner. Vinegar should not be used in
metal vessels unless porcelain-lined.</p>

<h1><a name="Brefield"></a>BREFIELD'S CLASSIFICATION OF FUNGI.</h1>


<p>A system of classification of fungi which is receiving attention from
mycologists is that recently presented by the distinguished German author
Dr. Oscar Brefield. Dr. Brefield's exhaustive investigations into the
life-history of fungi in general have been such as to entitle his views to
consideration, although the system presents some inconsistencies which
may prevent its adoption in its entirety.</p>

<p>According to the Brefield system, as summarized by his colleague Dr.
Von Tavel, Fungi are divided into two primary classes: (1) the <i>Phycomycetes,</i>
or lower fungi nearest like the algæ, <i>consisting of a one-celled thallus
with sexual as well as non-sexual modes of reproduction</i>, and (2) the
Mesomycetes and the Mycomycetes, <i>having a divided or many celled
thallus, propagated by non-sexually formed spores</i>. The Phycomycetes
are further divided into two large sections, based on their methods of
reproduction, termed, respectively, Zygomycetes and Oomycetes. These
include the old typical Mucors, the Peronosporeæ or "rotting moulds,"
once classed with the Hyphomycetes, the Saprolegniaceæ, "Fish Moulds,"
of aquatic habit, the Entomophthoraceæ, "Insect Moulds," together with
some minor groups. The Mesomycetes connect the Phycomycetes with
the Mycomycetes. The class Mycomycetes is primarily divided into two
sections, viz., Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes, with the Ustilagineæ,
"Smut Fungi," in Mesomycetes, forming a transitional group between
Phycomycetes and the Basidiomycetal group of the higher fungi.</p>

<p>The Ascomycetes are primarily subdivided into <i>Exoasci</i> and <i>Carpoasci,</i>
groups based on the character of the asci. In the first, <i>Exoasci,</i> the asci
are naked and borne directly on the mycelium; in the second, <i>Carpoasci,</i>
they are enclosed in a wrapper composed of fertile hyphæ and sterile
threads, having also accessory fruit forms. The first includes Endomycetes
and Taphrineæ. In the second are included the groups Gymnoasci,
Perisporaceæ, Pyrenomycetes, Hysteriaceæ, Discomycetes, and Helvellaceæ.</p>

<p>The Basidiomycetes characterized by the possession of basidia are
arranged in two groups, based on the character of the basidia: (1) the
Protobasidiomycetes, in which the basidia are septate, divided, and (2)
the Autobasidiomycetes, in which the basidia are not divided, and bear a
definite number of spores.</p>

<p>The first of these (Protobasidiomycetes) includes the following distinct
groups: (1) the Uredineæ, "Rust Fungi," which have horizontally
divided basidia, always free, never enclosed; (2) the Auricularieæ, having
basidia somewhat resembling those of the Uredineæ, but which are borne
in fruit bodies with open hymenia; (3) Pileacreæ, having horizontal
septate basidia in closed receptacles; and (4) Tremellineæ, having vertically
divided basidia borne in gymnocarpous receptacles&mdash;that is, those
in which the hymenium is exposed while the spores are growing.</p>

<p>The Autobasidiomycetes are characterized by undivided basidia, bearing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3-19" id="Page_3-19">[Pg 3-19]</a></span>spores only at the apex. This group is subdivided into three sections:
(1) Dacryomycetes, which includes the lowest of the Tremelloid
forms, with club-shaped basidia, nearly approaching the true Hymenomycetal
type, together with several groups of minor import; (2) Gasteromycetes;
and (3) Hymenomycetes, with Phalloideæ placed in the group
as a subsection of Gasteromycetes.</p>

<p>The above can only be considered as a very brief abstract of the system
of classification proposed by Dr. Brefield, but it will serve to give some
idea of the principle on which the system is based, which is sufficient for
our present purpose. Those who wish to study the system in detail will
find it treated in a comprehensive manner in Dr. Von Tavel's summary
as it appears in the <i>Vergleichende Morphologie der Pilze</i>, Jena, 1892.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h1><a name="Coniomycetes"></a>CONIOMYCETES AND HYPHOMYCETES.</h1>


<p>In the original classification of Fries two of the primary divisions of
the sporiferous Fungi were termed, respectively, <i>Coniomycetes</i> and <i>Hyphomycetes</i>.
This arrangement was accepted by Berkeley, the term <i>Coniomycetes</i>
being applied to all fungi in which the naked spores, appearing
like an impalpable dust, were the principal feature of the plant, and the
term <i>Hyphomycetes</i> to fungi in which the threads or hyphæ bearing the
spores were the most conspicuous feature.</p>

<p>Coniomycetes, as broadly interpreted by Berkeley and other mycologists
of his day, included the Uredineæ or "rust fungi," the Ustilagines
or "smut fungi," the Sphæropsideæ, and the Melanconieæ. This arrangement
was very unsatisfactory on account of the distinctively different
character of the methods of reproduction of the respective groups, and
they have since been disassociated and by some authors ranked as distinct
orders or families. Others combine Uredinei and Ustilaginei in one
group under the name Hypodermei.</p>

<p>Familiar examples of Uredinei are seen in the rust of the Barberry leaf,
etc., and of the Ustilaginei in the "smut" of corn and the "bunt" of
wheat.</p>

<p>Some authors combine the Sphæropsideæ with the closely allied Melanconieæ.
M. C. Cooke contends that the <i>Sphæropsideæ</i> should be considered
apart from the <i>Melanconieæ,</i> on the fundamental basis that the
former possess a distinct perithecium, while the latter do not.</p>

<p>The <i>Sphæropsideæ</i> as recently defined by Cooke are "Fungi <i>possessed
of a perithecium, but without asci</i>, ... sporules or stylospores being produced
internally at the apex of more or less distinct supporting hyphæ
or pedicels, termed sporophores."</p>

<p>The Sphæropsideæ somewhat resemble the Pyrenomyceteæ in external
characteristics, but differ from them in the absence of asci and paraphyses.
Saccardo retains all the species in his Sylloge, but relegates them
to an inferior position as imperfect fungi.</p>

<p>The group <i>Pyrenomycetes</i>, or <i>Sphæriacei</i>, as at first recognized by
<i>Fries</i>, included not only the <i>Sphæriacei</i> and the <i>Perisporacei</i>, but also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3-20" id="Page_3-20">[Pg 3-20]</a></span>the <i>Sphæropsidei</i> and <i>Melanconiaceæ</i>. Later, when ascigerous fungi
were separated from stylosporous fungi, this group was revised, the ascigerous
species only being retained. As at present limited, the Pyrenomycetes
are "<i>ascigerous</i> fungi having the fructification enclosed within a
perithecium."</p>

<p>They constitute a very large group, the described species, according to
Cooke's Census of Fungi, numbering not less than 10,500, or at least
1,000 more than all the recorded species of Hymenomycetes. The plants
are microscopic in size, and grow upon vegetable or animal substances.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h1><a name="Hyphomycetes"></a>HYPHOMYCETES.</h1>


<p>With regard to the Hyphomycetes, Cooke takes the ground that in their
internal relations to each other, and their external relations to the remaining
orders, the Hyphomycetes are undoubtedly a well-defined and natural
group, and should have place as such in a systematic work. It is a large
order, containing nearly 5,000 species, mostly parasitic on dead animals
and vegetable matter. The spores, termed conidia, are free, as in Hymenomycetes.
The species are microscopic in size, and the hyphæ are
strongly developed. They have no hymenium and no true basidia, and
are non-sexual in their reproduction.</p>

<p>The four primary sections are the Mucedineæ, or "white moulds;" the
Dematieæ, or "black moulds;" the Stilbea, with the hyphæ or thread-like
filaments pallid or brown, and densely cohering, and the Tubercularieæ,
with the hyphæ densely compacted in wart-like pustules of somewhat
gelatinous consistency.</p>

<p>The divisions called Melanconieæ, Sphæropsideæ, and Hyphomyceteæ
are not recognized in the Brefield system of classification as distinct
groups. Massee and Cooke, with other mycologists, take exception to
this omission and its implication, in their discussion of the subject,
giving consistent reasons for the retention of these groups in systematic
works.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h1><a name="Phycomycetes"></a>PHYCOMYCETES OR PHYSOMYCETES.</h1>


<p>As originally defined by Berkeley, this group was composed chiefly of
the old typical Mucors and their allies, and was then termed Physomycetes.
In the newer system of classification its original definition has
been extended so as to include a number of groups somewhat dissimilar
in their habits and characteristics, but "united under the conservating
bond of a dimorphic reproduction," and the name has been changed to
Phycomycetes. As at present recognized "the Phycomycetes are characterized
by a unicellular mycelium, often parasitic on plants or animals,
sometimes saprophytic, developed in the air or in water. Reproduction
sexual or asexual." As thus interpreted, Phycomycetes includes the
Mucoracei; the Peronosporaceæ, or "rotting moulds;" the Cystopi, or
"white rusts;" the Saprolegniaceæ, or "fish moulds;" the Entomophthoraceæ,

<p>Although some writers apply the terms spore, sporidia, sporophore, sporules, and
conidia somewhat indiscriminately to all spore bodies, in order to avoid confusion, it
is now recommended by the best authorities that certain distinctive limitations should
be adhered to in the use of these terms. Saccardo, in defining the terms which he
employs, accepts the term spores as applicable exclusively to the naked spores supported
on basidia, as found in the Basidiomyceteæ. The term sporidia he limits to
spores produced or enclosed in an ascus, as in the Ascomyceteæ. The term sporules
he applies to the spores of imperfect fungi, where they are enclosed in perithecia
(microscopic cups or cells), such as the Sphæropsidea. The term conidia he uses to
designate the spores of imperfect fungi without perithecia or asci, such as the Hyphomyceteæ
and the Melanconieæ. This arrangement is in accordance with M. C. Cooke's
published views on the subject, except in the case of the spore bodies of the Melanconieæ,
which he prefers, for well-defined reasons, to call sporules.</p>

<p>In accordance with these limitations, the terms <i>spermatia</i>, <i>stylospores</i>, and <i>clinospores</i>
are merged in <i>sporule</i>.</p>

<p>Other terms appropriate to their development are employed to designate the spores
of Uredineæ, Phycomyceteæ, etc.</p>

<h1><a name="Gasteromycetes"></a>GASTEROMYCETES.</h1>


<p>Hymenium more or less permanently concealed, consisting in most
cases of closely packed cells of which the fertile ones (the basidia) bear
naked spores on distinct spicules, exposed only by the rupture or decay
of the investing coat or peridium. Berkeley's Outlines.</p>

<p>This family has been subjected to numerous revisions since the days
of Fries, when its structural characteristics were not so well understood
as at present.</p>

<p>Montagne and Berkeley are credited with being the first to show the
true structure of the hymenium in the puff-balls, as well as to demonstrate
the presence of basidia. This important discovery led to the
correlating of the Gasteromycetes with the Hymenomycetes under the
common title Basidiomycetes, both having the spores borne upon basidia.
The two families still remained distinct, however, not only because of the
dissimilarity in their external features but principally on account of the
difference in the disposition and character of the hymenium.</p>

<p>In the Hymenomycetes the hymenium is exposed to the light from the
first, and the spores drop from the basidia as they mature; whereas in
the Gasteromycetes the hymenial pulp, or gleba, consisting of the spores
with the supporting basidia and the hyphæ, is enclosed within the substance
of the fungus, and the spores are exposed only on the decay of
the investing coat.</p>

<p>The basidia of the Gasteromycetes, though resembling those of the
Hymenomycetes, are more variable in form and the number of the spores
not so constant. They perform the same functions and bear spicules,
sometimes in pairs, sometimes quaternate, each spicule being surmounted
by a spore. They dissolve away as the spores mature and can, therefore,
only be observed in the very young stage of the plant. The spores of
the Gasteromycetes are usually colored and, except in the subterranean
species, globose. As seen through the microscope they have often a
rough warty appearance, sometimes spinulose. Paraphyses may be
present as aborted basidia, but cystidia are rarely distinguished. A
characteristic of a large proportion of the plants is the drying up of the
hymenial substance, so that the cavity of the receptacle becomes at length
filled with a dusty mass composed of spores and delicate threads, the
remains of the shriveled hyphæ.</p>

<p>The following table will serve to show the distinctive features of the
four primary divisions of the <span class="smcap">Gasteromycetes</span>:</p>

<ul class="lsoff" style="margin-left:3em;text-indent:-3em;">
<li><i>Lycoperdaceæ</i>.&mdash;Hymenium fugitive, drying in a dusty mass of threads
and spores, dispersed by an opening or by fissures of the peridium.
Terrestrial.</li>

<li><i>Phalloideæ</i>.&mdash;Hymenium deliquescent and slimy; receptacle pileate;
volva universal. F&oelig;tid fleshy fungi.</li>

<li><span class="pagenum" style="text-indent:0em;"><a name="Page_4-4" id="Page_4-4">[Pg 4-4]</a></span><i>Hypogæi</i>, or <i>Hymenogastreæ</i>.&mdash;Hymenium permanent, not becoming
dusty or deliquescent except when decayed. Capillitium wanting.
Subterranean.</li>

<li><i>Nidulariaceæ</i>.&mdash;Receptacle cup-shaped or globose; spores produced on
sporophores or short basidia enclosed in globose or disciform bodies
(sporangia) contained within a distinct peridium. Terrestrial.</li>
</ul>

<p>The section Lycoperdaceæ contains upwards of 500 species or more
than two-thirds of the whole number of recorded species of the Gasteromycetes.
Lycoperdon, Bovista, and Geaster, its most conspicuous genera,
are said to contain the largest number of well-known species. A few are
edible.</p>

<p>The Phalloideæ include about 90 species. The plants are usually ill-smelling
and unwholesome. Some are stipitate, others are latticed, etc.
Some are conspicuous for their bright coloring. In the young stage
they are enclosed in an egg-shaped volva having a gelatinous inner
stratum.</p>

<p>The plants of the Nidulariaceæ are very minute, tough, and widely
distributed. The species Cyathus, the "bird's-nest fungus," is quite
common in some localities, and is interesting because of its peculiar form.
The individual plant is very small, not more than two centimeters high.
It resembles an inverted bell, or a miniature wine-glass. A delicate white
membrane covers the top at first. This disappears as the plant matures,
revealing lentil-shaped bodies packed closely together like eggs in a nest.
These oval bodies are the peridiola containing the spores. They are
usually found upon rotten wood or sticks on the ground. Sixty-five
species are recorded, but none are edible.</p>

<p>The plants of the division Hypogæi or Hymenogastreæ are subterranean
in habit, preferring a sandy soil. They are usually somewhat globose in
form, having a thick outer coat or peridium, though in some of the genera
the outer coat is very thin or obsolete. They are dingy in color. In the
young plants the interior substance somewhat resembles that of the
truffle, but is streaked and mottled. When old the gleba consists of a
dusty mass of threads and spores. They are known under various appellations,
such as "underground puff-balls," "false truffles," etc.</p>

<p>The Hypogæi are analogous to the Tuberacei, except that the spores
are not contained in asci as in the latter. Cooke says they appear to be
the link which unites the Basidiomycetes to the Ascomycetes by means
of the Tuberacei or genuine Truffles. In the young stage the basidia in
the Hypogæi are easily distinguished by the aid of the microscope.</p>

<p>In external features and habit of growth the species of Elaphomyces,
a genus of Tuberacei, closely resemble the Hypogæi, and in old age,
when the <i>asci</i> have disappeared, it is difficult to distinguish the plants of
this genus from the Hypogæi.</p>

<p>The genus <i>Melanogaster</i> contains an edible species, <i>M. variegatus</i>,
Tulasne, commonly known in Europe as the "Red Truffle" or "False
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4-5" id="Page_4-5">[Pg 4-5]</a></span>Truffle." <i>M. variegatus</i> is usually gregarious and subterranean in habit.
The exterior is minutely granular, tawny yellow or reddish rust color;
the interior soft, bluish-black, streaked with yellow, the spore mass in
maturity becoming pubescent. The odor is pleasantly aromatic, and the
taste sweet. Under trees in woods. The variety <i>Broomeianus</i> Berk. is
paler in the marbling, which shows reddish instead of yellow streaks.
The pulpy mass is at first white, changing to a yellowish, smoky hue.</p>

<p class="center"><a name="Descriptions5"></a><span class="smcap">Lycoperdaceæ and Phalloideæ.</span></p>

<p>The plants figured in <a href="#PLATE_G">Plates G</a> and <a href="#PLATE_H">H</a> belong to the Lycoperdaceæ and
Phalloideæ.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lycoperdaceæ.</span></p>

<p>Massee, who has given the Puff-Ball group very close study, says that in
the gleba of the Lycoperdaceæ, "at a very early period two sets of hyphæ
are present. One, thin-walled, colorless, septate and rich in protoplasm,
gives origin to the trama, and elements of the hymenium, and usually
disappears entirely after the formation of the spores; the second type
consists of long thick-walled aseptate or sparsely septate, often colored
hyphæ, which are persistent and form the capillitium. The latter are
branches of the hyphæ forming the hymenium."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Genera Lycoperdon and Bovista.</span></p>

<p>To the genera Lycoperdon and Bovista belong most of the "Puff-balls"
and all of the species figured in <a href="#PLATE_G">Plate G</a>. In the plants of these two genera
the peridium is more or less distinctly double, and the hyphæ, or delicate
threads which are seen mixed with the dusty mass of spores in the
mature plant, forming what is called the capillitium, are an important
element in classification.</p>

<p><i>Genus Lycoperdon</i> Tourn. In this genus the investing coat or peridium
is membranaceous, vanishing above or becoming flaccid; bark or
outer shell adnate, sub-persistent, breaking up into scales or warts; capillitium
soft, dense, and attached to the peridium, base spongy and sterile.</p>

<p class="center">EDIBLE PUFF-BALLS.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;<b>Lycoperdon cælatum</b> Fries. "<i>Collapsing Puff-Ball</i>."</p>

<p>Peridium flaccid above, with mealy coating, obtuse, at length collapsing,
the sterile stratum cellulose. Inner peridium distinct from the outer all
round; capillitium nearly free, collapsing when mature, threads long
and brittle; spores dingy olive, turning brown; base stem-like, broad
and blunt, with root, obconical, somewhat spongy. Common in pastures
and open woods. Edible when young, but not much commended. Plant
pale cream color.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4-6" id="Page_4-6">[Pg 4-6]</a></span></p>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 2 and 3.&mdash;<b>Lycoperdon gemmatum</b> Batsch. "<i>Warted Puff-Ball</i>," "<i>Studded
Puff-Ball</i>."</p>

<p>Plant sub-globular, with a stem-like base; white or cinereous, turning
to light greyish-brown, the surface warty, the warts unequal, the larger
ones somewhat pointed, the smaller granular. As the warts fall off they
leave the surface of the denuded peridium somewhat dotted or slightly
reticulated. Flesh, when young, firm and whitish. The plants of this
species are small, variable in form, sometimes turbinated, sometimes nearly
globose, or depressed globose, but usually the basal portion is narrower
than the upper portion. The stem varies in thickness and length; sometimes
it is quite elongated, in some instances absent. Capillitium and
spores yellowish-green, turning dark olive or brown. Columella present.
When the spores are fully ripe the peridium opens by a small apical aperture
for their dispersion. The plants are sometimes densely cæspitose,
and crowd together on the ground or on decaying wood in large patches
after warm rains. They are found both in fields and open woods during
summer and autumn. They are edible when young, but not specially
well flavored. There are several varieties. Plants sometimes oval or
lens-shaped.</p>

<p>In Var. <i>hirtum</i> the plant is turbinate, subsessile, and hairy, with slender,
spinous warts. The variety <i>papulatum</i> is subrotund, sessile, papillose
and pulverulent, the warts being nearly uniform in size. Plants from one
to two inches in height.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 4 and 5.&mdash;<b>Lycoperdon pyriforme</b> Schaeffer. "<i>Pear-Shaped Puff-Ball</i>."</p>

<p>Plant dingy white or brownish yellow; pear-shaped, or obovate pyriforme,
sometimes approaching L. gemmatum in size and shape, but easily
distinguished from that species by the surface features of the peridium
and the internal hyphæ. The persistent warts which cover the surface
of the peridium are so minute as to appear to the naked eye like scales.
In some instances the peridium is almost smooth, and sometimes cracks
in areas, inner peridium thin and tough. The hyphæ are thicker than the
spores and branched, continuous with the slightly cellular base, and forming
a columella inside the peridium. Spores greenish-yellow, then brownish-olive,
smooth and globose.</p>

<p>The short stem-like base of the plant terminates in fiber-like rootlets,
creeping under the soil and branching, thus attaching large clusters of
the young plants together. They are often found in quantity on the
mossy trunks of fallen trees.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 6.&mdash;<b>Lycoperdon giganteum</b> Batsch. "<i>Giant Puff-Ball</i>."</p>

<p>The Giant Puff-Ball, so generally neglected, is one of the most valuable
of the edible mushrooms. It is readily distinguished from other puff-balls
and allied fungi by its large size. It is subglobose in form, often flattened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4-7" id="Page_4-7">[Pg 4-7]</a></span>at the top and usually wider than deep. The peridium or rind is membranaceous,
smooth, or very slightly floccose, and creamy white at first,
turning to pale yellowish-brown when the plant is old. When young it
is filled with a white, seemingly homogeneous fleshy substance of pleasant
flavor. This substance changes, when mature, to an elastic, yellowish
or olivaceous brown, cottony but dusty mass of filaments and spores.
The peridium is very fragile above, cracking into areæ in the mature
plant and breaking up and falling away in fragments, thus allowing the
dispersion of the spores. The capillitium and spores are at first
greenish-yellow, turning to dingy olive. The plants vary in size, but
average from ten to twenty inches in diameter. In the columns of the
<i>Country Gentleman</i> some years ago there appeared a description of a
puff-ball of this species which weighed forty seven pounds and measured
a little over eight feet in circumference. It was found in a low, moist
corner of a public park. Specimens weighing from twenty to thirty
pounds are recorded as being found in different parts of the country; but
specimens of such large dimensions are unusual. This species is found
in many parts of the United States. It is the L. <i>bovista</i> of Linn. Sacc.</p>

<p>A correspondent writes that he has found the giant puff-ball in great
abundance growing on the Genessee Flats, Livingstone Co., New York.
Another writes from Nebraska that it is quite abundant on the prairies
there in summer. A third writes from Missouri, "Since the late rains we
have had puff-balls in abundance, and find them delicious made into fritters."</p>

<p>The puff-balls should be gathered young. If the substance within is
white and pulpy, it is in good condition for cooking, but if marked with
yellow stains it should be rejected.</p>

<p>Vittadini says:</p>

<p>"When the giant puff-ball is conveniently situated you should only
take one slice at a time, cutting it horizontally and using great care not
to disturb its growth, to prevent decay, and thus one may have a fritter
every day for a week."</p>

<p>Different authors write with enthusiasm of the merits of the giant puff-ball
as an esculent.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hussey, an English botanist, gives the following receipt for "puff-ball
omelet:"</p>

<p>First, remove the outer skin; cut in slices half an inch thick; have
ready some chopped herbs, pepper, and salt; dip the slices in the yolk
of an egg, and sprinkle the herbs upon them; fry in fresh butter, and eat
immediately.</p>

<p>I have tested fine specimens of the giant puff-ball gathered in the
public parks of Washington, D. C., finding it delicious eating when fried
in batter.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4-8" id="Page_4-8">[Pg 4-8]</a></span></p>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 7 and 8.&mdash;<b>Lycoperdon cyathiforme</b> Bose. "<i>Cup-shaped Puff-Ball</i>."</p>

<p>Synonyms&mdash;L. fragile Vitt. L. albopurpureum Frost.</p>

<p>Plant nearly globose, with a short, thick, stem-like base, color varying,
cinereous, brown, tinged with violet.</p>

<p>Rind or peridium smooth, or minutely floccose, scaly in the mature
plant, cracking into somewhat angular areas, the upper portion finally
falling away in fragments, leaving a wide cup-shaped base, with irregular
margin, which remains long after the dispersion of the spores and capillitium.
This basal portion is often tinged with the purplish hue of the
spores. Spores rough, purplish-brown. Capillitium same color as the
spores.</p>

<p>Lycoperdon <i>cyathiforme</i> is a more common species than L. <i>giganteum</i>,
and is deemed quite equal to the latter in flavor. The plants are of good
size, being from 4 to 10 inches in diameter.</p>

<p>They are frequently found in open fields and grassy places after electric
storms. When sliced and fried in egg batter, they taste much like the
<i>giganteum</i> or <i>giant puff-ball</i>.</p>

<p>A puff-ball which is not inferior to either of the two last-named species,
though not as large, and perhaps not as abundant as either, is the Lycoperdon
<i>saccatum</i> of Fries, sometimes called the "Long-stemmed puff-ball,"
because of its elongated stem.</p>

<p>The plants of this species are attractive in appearance, usually hemispherical,
or lentiform in shape, with cylindrical stem-like base. The peridium
is thin and delicate, breaking into fragments; creamy white in the
young stage, and clothed with delicate warts, so minute as to give the
surface a soft mealy appearance, the under surface somewhat plicate.
Capillitium sub-persistent and dense. Both spores and capillitium
brown.</p>




<p class="center">LYCOPERDACEÆ.</p>


<p><i>Genus Bovista</i> Dill. Peridium papery (or sometimes corky), persistent;
the outer rind, sometimes called the bark, quite distinct from the
inner, at length shelling off. Capillitium sub-compact, equal, adnate to
the peridium on all sides; spores pedicillate, brownish.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 9 and 10.&mdash;<b>Bovista plumbea</b> Pers. <i>Lead-Colored Bovista</i>.</p>

<p>Plant small, spherical, having a double shell or peridium, the inner one
white and the outer one smooth and greyish lead-color or bluish-grey, and
shelling off at maturity. When young the interior is filled with a creamy
white substance. This soon begins to disintegrate, and, as the spores
mature, changes to a mass of dusty brown spores and threads. When
the spores are ready for dissemination a small aperture appears in the top
of the peridium, through which they push their way outwards like a little
puff of smoke.</p>

<p>When young, and while the flesh is white throughout, the plant is
edible, although so small that it would take a quantity to make a good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4-9" id="Page_4-9">[Pg 4-9]</a></span>dish. It is found chiefly in pastures in the autumn. Sometimes found
growing in company with Agaricus campestris. Of pleasant flavor when
young.</p>

<p style="margin-top:2em;">Fig. 11. Basidium and spores of a Lycoperdon highly magnified.</p>

<p>An English author states that inflammation of the throat and swelling
of the tongue have been known to ensue from eating some of the small
species of Lycoperdon in the raw state. It would be a wise precaution,
therefore, to cook all of the smaller species well before eating.</p>

<p>The genus Scleroderma is allied to Lycoperdon, but differs from it in
the absence of a capillitium, and in the thick indehiscent outer skin, or
peridium, which bursts irregularly on the maturity of the spore-mass, the
flocci adhering on all sides to the peridium and forming distinct veins in
the central mass.</p>

<p>The species Scleroderma <i>vulgare</i> is very common in woods, and has
sometimes been mistaken for a form of Truffle. The plants are not very
attractive, and the odor is rank. They are subsessile and irregular in
shape, with a hard outer skin, the larger form of a yellowish or greenish
brown hue, and covered with large warts or scales, the smaller very
minutely warty, and of a darker brown hue. The internal mass is of a
bluish-black hue, threaded through with white or greyish flocci. Spores
dingy. The interior becomes pulverulent when the plant matures. This
species has been eaten in its young state when cooked, but the flavor is
by no means equal to that of the large puff-balls. It is sometimes
attacked by a fungus larger than itself, called Boletus <i>parasiticus</i>, and this
parasite is again attacked by a species of Hypomyces, one of the genera
of the Pyrenomycetes, which grows in patches upon dead fungi.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Phalloideæ or Phallaceæ.</span></p>

<p>The Phalloideæ, sometimes called the "Stink-horn" fungi on account
of their f&oelig;tid odor, are not numerous, the whole number of described
species being about eighty. The plants are watery, quick in growth,
and decay very rapidly. They are varied in form and are quite unlike
the ordinary mushroom types. In some of the genera the plants are
columnar and phalloid, in other clathrate or latticed, in others again
the disk is stellate, and in one genus it is coralloid, but they are all enclosed,
in the early stage, in a volva which is at first hidden or partially
hidden beneath the surface of the ground. A gelatinous stratum is
contained within the firmer outside membrane.</p>


<p><i>Genus Ithyphallus</i>. In this genus the cap is perforated at the top,
free from the stem and reticulate. No veil. The mature plants are
columnar in form with the remains of the volva enclosing the column-like
stem at the base; the cap in its deeply pitted reticulations somewhat
resembling that of the <i>Morel</i>, although of different texture.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 1 to 6.&mdash;<b>Ithyphallus</b> <i>impudicus</i> Linn. "<i>F&oelig;tid Wood Witch</i>."</p>

<p>In the embryonic stage the plant is enclosed in a volva which is composed
of three layers, the outer one firm, the intermediate one gelatinous,
and the inner one consisting of a thin membrane. The gleba, or spore-bearing
portion, in the early stage forms a conical honeycombed cap
within the inner shell or membrane, concealing the stem to which it is
attached. The stem at this stage is very short, cylindrical, and composed
of small cells filled with a gelatinous substance. The volva is about the
size of a hen's egg. On maturity it ruptures at the apex. The stem
rapidly expands and, elongating, elevates the cap into the air. The stem
becomes open and spongy, owing to the drying of the gelatinous matter
and its quick expansion.</p>

<p>The whole plant attains a height of from four to ten inches in a few
hours. The hymenial surface is on the outside of the cap, the spores
being embedded in its glutinous coated ridges and depressions. The
hymenium is at first firm but rapidly deliquesces, holding the spores in
the liquid mass. The cap is greenish or greenish-gray in color, changing
to a dark bottle-green. In its deliquescent state the odor is very repulsive.
While enclosed in the volva the unpleasant odor is not so perceptible,
and it has been eaten in that condition without unpleasant effects,
but in its mature stage it is considered unwholesome, and certainly its
offensive odor would be quite sufficient to deter most persons from attempting
to test its edible qualities. Flies, however, are very fond of the
fluid, and consume it greedily and with impunity. It is found in gardens
and woods, its presence being detected several rods away by the offensive
odor. Specimens occur in which the color of the cap is white or
reddish.</p>

<p>In the allied genus <i>Mutinus</i> the pileus is adnate and is not perforated
at the apex. Mutinus <i>caninus</i> resembles <i>impudicus</i> in form, but the cap
is continuous with, not free from the stem, and is crimson in color, covered
with a greenish-brown, odorless mucus. The stem is hollow, whitish,
tinted with a pale yellow or orange color. Not common.</p>


<p><i>Genus Clathrus</i> Mich. In this genus the receptacle is sessile, and
formed of an obovate globular net-work. At first wholly enclosed in a
volva which becomes torn at the apex and falls away, leaving a calyx-like
base at its point of contact with the stem.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 7.&mdash;<b>Clathrus cancellatus</b> Tourn.</p>

<h1><a name="Myxomycetes"></a>MYXOMYCETES OR MYXOGASTERS.&mdash;"<i>Slime Fungi</i>."</h1>


<p>In their early history the Myxomycetes, or "slime moulds," were classed
with the gasteromycetal fungi, and by Fries grouped as a sub-order of the
Gasteromycetes, under the name Myxogasters. From this connection
they were severed in 1833 by Link, who, recognizing certain distinctive
features which entitled them to consideration as an entirely separate
group, ranked the Myxogasters, as a separate order, under the title <i>Myxomycetes</i>,
<i>Slime moulds</i>. De Bary, in a monograph on the subject written
some years later, questioned the right of this group to the place assigned
it in the vegetable world, claiming that the Myxogasters were as nearly
related to the animal as to the vegetable kingdom, and changing the name
to Mycetozoa. Massee assailed this position in his "Monograph of the
Myxogasters," pointing out that De Bary derived his reasons and deductions
from the early or vegetative stage of the fungi, without taking sufficiently
into account the characteristics of the later or reproductive stage
in which the great disparity between these organisms and those of the
lower animals becomes apparent.</p>

<p>Dr. Rostafinski, the Polish botanist, and pupil of De Bary, adopts the
name given the group by De Bary, but applies it in a more restricted
sense, classifying on a botanical basis. Both De Bary and Massee have
their earnest disciples. M. C. Cooke takes the ground that the Myxomycetes
are entitled to mention as "<i>fungi</i> which produce their fructification
enclosed within a peridium," although considering them as an
aberrant group which, on account of certain peculiarities of their early or
vegetative stage, should no longer be classed as having affinity with
Gasteromycetes. Without further discussion of the subject, it is sufficient,
for our present purpose, to state that mycologists now very generally
agree in regarding this group as quite distinct from the Gasteromycetes.</p>

<p>The species are minute, rarely exceeding a millimeter in diameter, at first
pulpy, then dry. In the early or vegetative stage the "slime mould" is plasmoidal,
consisting of a mass of protoplasm without cell wall, and prefers
damp surfaces, such as rotting leaves, moist logs, etc. The whole substance
is slippery or slimy and presents different hues, red, orange, violet,
brown, etc., according to species, but never green. It is in the reproductive
or fruiting stage that their resemblance to microscopic puff-balls
appears, the sporangium in many species exhibiting a distinct peridium
or outer coat which encloses the spores together with the hair-like threads
called the capillitium. On the ripening of the spores this peridium ruptures,
allowing their escape, the capillitium lending valuable aid in their
dissemination.</p>

<p class="center"><a name="Descriptions6"></a>AGARICINI.</p>


<p><i>Subgenus Lepiota</i> Fries. Veil universal and concrete, with the cuticle
of the pileus breaking up in the form of scales. Gills typically free, often
remote, not sinuate or decurrent. Stem generally distinct from the
hymenophore. Volva absent. Habitat terrestrial, mostly found on rich
soil or in grassy places. (In Saccardo's <i>Sylloge</i>, Lepiota is given generic
rank.)</p>

<p>The Lepiotas have a wide geographical distribution. No less than 225
species have been recorded as found in different parts of the world.
These are pretty evenly divided between the torrid and temperate zones.
They are generally smaller than the Amanitas, less fleshy and somewhat
dry and tough. The flesh is soft and thready, not brittle. In the plants
of most of the species the cap is rough, the cuticle being broken up into
tufts or scales. These tufts are readily distinguished from the warts
which characterize certain species of Amanita, being formed from the
breaking up of the cuticle with the concrete veil, while the wart-like excrescences
seen upon Amanita <i>muscaria</i>, for example, are composed of
fragments of the volva, which is always found enclosing the very young
plants of the genus Amanita.</p>

<p>A few of the species are characterized by a smooth cap; in some instances
it is granulose or mealy. Usually the cuticle is dry, but in a few
of the species it is viscid. The stem is generally long and hollow, and,
being of different texture from the flesh of the cap, is easily separated
from it, often leaving a distinct socket at the junction of stem and cap.
It is sometimes smooth, sometimes floccose. In some species it is bulbous
at the base, in others not. The ring which encircles the stem is at
first continuous with the cuticle of the cap, breaking apart with its expansion.
It is sometimes movable, sometimes evanescent.</p>

<p>The species generally are considered edible, or innoxious. None are
recorded as dangerous. A mycophagist from Augusta, Ga., reports,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4-14" id="Page_4-14">[Pg 4-14]</a></span>however, that the members of a family in that vicinity were made quite
ill from eating the Lepiota <i>Morgani</i>, a greenish-spored species of Lepiota,
while he himself ate of the same dish, experiencing no unpleasant effects.
I have had no personal experience with this species.</p>

<p>Two edible species of Lepiota, which are widely commended as of good
quality, and which are sufficiently abundant to have value as esculents,
are figured in Plate XI. A third, Ag. (Lepiota) cepæstipes, var. cretaceus&mdash;Lepiota
<i>cretacea</i>, figured in <a href="#PLATE_XIH">Plate XI½</a>, is an exotic species found
in greenhouses. It is of very delicate flavor.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Edible.</span></p>

<p>Cap at first ovate, then expanded, showing distinct umbo, cuticle thick,
torn into evanescent scales; gills remote from the stem, free, white, or
yellowish-white; stem long, slender, variegated with brownish scales,
hollow or slightly stuffed, bulbous at the base, and bearing a well-defined
thickish ring, which in the mature plant is movable. Spores white, elliptical.
The color of the cap varies from a light tan or ochraceous yellow
to a dark reddish-brown. The surface showing beneath the lacerated
cuticle is of a lighter hue than the cuticle, and is silky and fibrillose,
giving the cap a somewhat shaded or spotted appearance. The flesh is
dry, soft and thready, white. Taste and odor pleasant.</p>

<p>Cap from 3 to 5 inches broad; stem from 5 to 10 inches high.</p>

<p>This species is commonly found in pastures and in open grassy places;
sometimes in open woods near cultivated fields, usually solitary or in
very small clusters. It is a favorite among mycophagists. Lepiota
<i>racodes</i> closely resembles Lepiota <i>procera</i>, and by some botanists the
two are regarded as forms of the same species. In L. <i>racodes</i> the pileus
is at first globose, expanded, and finally depressed in the centre; the
cuticle is thin and broken into persistent scales; the whole plant smaller
than L. procera. Flesh slightly reddish when bruised. Edible. There
is also a white variety (<i>puellaris</i>) with a floccose squamose cap.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate</span> XI.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 5 to 9.&mdash;<b>Ag. (Lepiota) naucinus</b> Fries (<b>Lepiota naucinoides</b> Peck).
"<i>Smooth White Lepiota</i>."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Edible.</span></p>

<p>Cap at first sub-globose, then curved, the surface smooth and satiny
when dry, creamy white; gills close and slightly rounded at the inner
extremity towards the stem, free from the stem, white; stem white,
smooth, hollow, and bulbous at the base; ring thick, distinct, movable,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4-15" id="Page_4-15">[Pg 4-15]</a></span>white. The gills, soon after gathering, become suffused with a faint
pinkish or fleshy tint. The spores are white, sub-elliptical. Specimens
occur in which there is a slight granulation in the centre of the cap, but
they are rare. The variety <i>squamosa</i> shows the surface of the cap, somewhat
broken into thick scales.</p>

<p>L. <i>naucinoides</i> is a very clean and attractive looking mushroom, usually
symmetrical in shape. It is a fleshier mushroom than L. <i>procera</i>, and is
found in grassy places, in lawns, sometimes in gardens, or by roadsides,
especially where the soil is rich. The specimens figured in <a href="#PLATE_XI">Plate XI</a> were
gathered in a rose garden, growing in loamy soil. Specimens have been
received from different States, some of them much larger than those here
illustrated.</p>

<p>This mushroom is recorded by some authors as equal in flavor to the
Parasol mushroom. When stewed with butter it makes a very appetizing
dish.</p>

<p>There is a fatally poisonous mushroom to which it bears some resemblance,
and which might be taken for it, viz., Amanita <i>verna</i>, or "Spring
mushroom." It is therefore necessary, in order to guard against such a
mistake, to give particular attention to the characteristics of these two
mushrooms. They are both white throughout, and both have white spores
and ringed stem. Amanita <i>verna</i>, however, carries a white volva or cup-shaped
sheath at the base of the stem, and the gills do not show a pinkish
or flesh colored tinge at any stage. In Lepiota <i>naucinoides</i>, as in all the
Lepiotas, the volva is wanting. Amanita <i>verna</i> is apt to be moist and
clammy to the touch, and is tasteless. L. <i>naucinoides</i> is dry, and has a
pleasant flavor. The first is found <i>wholly</i> in <i>woods</i>; the second prefers
pastures, open grassy places, and gardens, though sometimes found in
light woods. I have never found an Amanita in a lawn, pasture, or
garden.</p>

<p>An edible mushroom, Agaricus (Psalliota) <i>cretaceus</i>, found in pastures,
bears a slight resemblance to L. <i>naucinoides</i>, when the color of the spores
and gills are not taken into consideration. In the former the gills very
quickly change from their early stage of rosy pink to a dark purplish-brown
color, like that of the common mushroom. The spores are purplish-brown,
while in L. <i>naucinoides</i> the pinkish hue which tinges the
fading plant is very faint, and changes to a very light tan color with age.
The spores being white, the gills retain their white color for a long time,
never changing to dark brown.</p>

<p>L. <i>Americana</i> Pk. A. &amp; S., L. <i>excoriata</i> Schaeff., and L. <i>rubrotincta</i>
Pk. have been tested and are of good flavor.</p>

<p>L. <i>Americana</i> has a reddish or reddish-brown cap, umbonate, with
close adpressed scales and white flesh. The gills are broad and free from
the stem, sometimes anastomosing near it, white; stem white, hollow,
tapering towards the cap, annulate. When dried the whole plant has a
brownish-red hue. When cut or bruised it sometimes exudes a reddish
juice. Miss Banning reports specimens found in Druid Hill Park, Baltimore.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4-16" id="Page_4-16">[Pg 4-16]</a></span>I have gathered very beautiful specimens in Montgomery county,
Md. This mushroom sometimes grows to a very large size.</p>

<p>L. <i>excoriata</i> has a pale fawn-colored cap, slightly umbonate, with thin
cuticle, breaking into scales; gills remote, white; stem white, hollow, and
short, nearly cylindrical. Odor faint, pleasant.</p>

<p>L. <i>rubrotincta</i> Pk. "<i>Red-tinted Agaric</i>." Cap reddish or pinkish,
broadly umbonate and clothed with adpressed scales; gills whitish, free,
and close; stem nearly equal or slightly thickened at the base, with a
well-developed persistent white or pinkish ring. Spores white, sub-elliptical.</p>

<p>L. <i>holosericeus</i> Fries has a fleshy white cap, soft, silky, and fibrillose,
a solid bulbous stem, with persistent broad, reflexed ring, and free ventricose,
white gills. Edible. It is found in gardens and cultivated places.</p>

<p>L. <i>acutesquamosa</i> Wein, found in greenhouses and soil in gardens, is a
heavy but not very tall species. The cap is obtuse, and fleshy, at first
floccose. As the cap expands it bristles with erect pointed tufts or scales.
The gills are white or yellowish, lanceolate and simple, free from the
stem. Stem bulbous, somewhat stuffed, rough or silky below the ring,
and downy above. Ring persistent. Color of cap whitish or light brown,
with darker scales.</p>

<p>L. <i>granulosus</i> Batsch. Cap thin, wrinkled or corrugated, granulose,
mealy; gills white, <i>reaching the stem</i>, sometimes free. Plants very small
and varying in color&mdash;pink, yellow, and white, according to variety.</p>

<p>L. <i>amiantha</i>. Plants very small, ochraceous in color, with yellow flesh
and white gills <i>adnate</i> and crowded.</p>

<p>L. <i>cepæstipes</i> Sow. Cap thin, broad, sub-membranaceous, broadly
umbonate, adorned with mealy evanescent scales, margin irregular; gills
white, at length remote. Stem hollow and floccose, narrow at top,
ventricose; ring evanescent. Generally found in hothouses. Cap 1 to
3 inches broad. Stem 3 to 6 inches high. Spores white.</p>

<p>L. <i>cristata</i> is a common species found on lawns and in fields where the
grass is short. The plants are small, the cap from ½ to 1½ inches in
width. Not very fleshy. The cuticle of the cap is at first continuous and
smooth but soon breaks into reddish scales. The stem is fistulose,
slender and equal; gills free. Odor and taste somewhat strong and unpleasant.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Edible.</span></p>

<p>This very delicate and beautiful agaric is found on tan and leaves in
hothouses.</p>

<p>The specimens here delineated were gathered in one of the hothouses
of the Agricultural Department and first described and figured in <i>Food
Products</i>, No. 2, of the report of the Division of Microscopy. The plants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4-17" id="Page_4-17">[Pg 4-17]</a></span>are a pure white throughout, and both stem and pileus are covered with
small chalk-white mealy tufts. Berkeley says, "this species is probably
of exotic origin, as it never grows in the open air." It is also met with
in the hothouses of Europe. Specimens have been received from contributors
who gathered them in greenhouses in different localities. This
species should not be confounded with the purplish-brown spored mushroom
Agaricus (Psalliota) cretaceus, which has pink gills turning to
dark brown and is allied to the common meadow mushroom.</p>

<p>Lepiota <i>cretacea</i> is a delicious mushroom when broiled, or cooked in a
chafing dish, and served on hot buttered toast. It has a pleasant taste
when raw.</p>

<p>Lepiota <i>Morgani</i> Peck, the "<i>Green-Spored Lepiota</i>," is an exception
to the general type of Lepiotas in the color of its gills and spores. It is
western and southern in its range. This species is described by Peck in
the Botanical Gazette of March, 1897, p. 137, as follows: "Pileus fleshy,
soft, at first sub-globose, then expanded, or depressed, white, the brownish
or alutaceous cuticle breaking up into scales except on the disk;
lamellæ close, lanceolate, remote, white, then green; stem firm, equal, or
tapering upwards, sub-bulbous, smooth, webby-stuffed, whitish, tinged
with brown, annulus rather large, movable; flesh both of the pileus and
stem white, changing to reddish, and then to yellowish hue when cut or
bruised; spores ovate, sub-elliptical, mostly uninucleate, .0004 to .0005
inches long, .0003 to .00032 broad, sordid green.</p>

<p>"Plant 6 to 8 inches high, pileus 5 to 9 inches broad, stem 6 to 12 lines
thick. Open dry grassy places. Dayton, Ohio. A. P. Morgan."</p>



<p class="center">AGARICINI.</p>


<p><i>Genus Cortinarius</i> Fries. This genus is distinguished by a cob-web-like
veil, dry persistent gills, which in the mature plants become discolored,
and pulverulent with the rusty or ochraceous colored spores.
The veil is very delicate, resembling a spider's web. It is not concrete
with the cuticle of the cap, but extends from its margin to the stem, in
the young plants sometimes concealing the gills, but disappearing as the
cap expands. Sometimes a few filaments are seen depending from the
margin of the cap or encircling the stem.</p>

<p>In the young plants of this genus the gills vary very much in color.
They are whitish, clay-color, violet, dark purple, blood-red, etc., according
to species, but, as the plants mature, the gills become dusted with the
rust-colored falling spores, and with age usually become a rusty
ochraceous, or cinnamon color. The stem in some of the species is distinctly
bulbous and in others equal, cylindrical, or tapering. In identifying
the species it is necessary, in order to ascertain the true color of
the gills, to examine the plants at different periods of growth.</p>

<p>The genus Cortinarius is a large one, and contains many beautiful
species. It is mainly confined to temperate regions. Not a single
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4-18" id="Page_4-18">[Pg 4-18]</a></span>species has been recorded as found in Ceylon, the West Indies, or Africa,
but one tropical species is found in Brazil. Nearly four hundred species
have been described, and over three hundred and seventy of these belong
to the United States and Europe. A few are found in the extreme
southern or temperate portion of South America, and several are
reported from a temperate elevation among the Himalayas. Sweden and
Great Britain, with their temperate climates, claim a large proportion of
the European species. Not many of the Cortinarii have been recorded
as edible, and none as dangerous. The Rev. M. J. Berkeley records, however,
a case of poisoning by one of the species, C. (Inoloma) <i>bolaris</i>
Pers., which though not fatal was somewhat alarming, the symptoms
being great oppression of the chest, profuse perspiration, and the enlargement
for two days of the salivary glands of the patient. I have
seen no other statements relating to the poisonous properties of this
species, and the results alluded to may have been owing to some individual
idiosyncrasy.</p>

<p>Berkeley, in his "Outlines," gives the following description of this
mushroom: "Pileus fleshy, obsoletely umbonate, growing pale, variegated
with <i>saffron-red, adpressed, innate</i> scales; stem stuffed, then hollow,
nearly equal, squamose, of the same color as the cap; gills subdecurrent,
crowded, watery, cinnamon color. Cap 1 to 2 inches broad. Stem 2 to 3
inches long." In beech woods in September and October.</p>

<p>The genus Cortinarius has been divided by some authors into the following
six groups: (1) <i>Phlegmacium</i>, in which the cap is fleshy and viscid, the
veil partial, and the stem firm and dry; (2) <i>Myxacium</i>, in which the veil is
universal and glutinous, hence the cap and stem both viscid; cap thin
and the gills adnate or decurrent; (3) <i>Inoloma</i>, in which the cap is fleshy,
dry, and at first silky with innate fibrils; veil simple and stem slightly
bulbous; (4) Dermocybe, in which the pileus is thinly fleshy, dry, and
at first downy, becoming smooth; the veil single and fibrillose; flesh
watery, colored when moist, stem equal or attenuated downwards; (5)
Telamonia, in which the cap is moist, at first smooth or dotted with the
superficial fragments of the veil, the stem ringed below, or peronately
scaly from the remains of the universal veil; (6) Hydrocybe, in which the
cap is thin and moist, not viscid, smooth, or covered with superficial white
fibrils; stem rigid, not scaly, veil thin, occasionally collapsed in an irregular
ring. These subdivisions have been designated as <i>tribes</i> by some
botanists and <i>subgenera</i> by others, etc. To the divisions Inoloma and
Phlegmacium, respectively, belong the two species illustrated in Plate XII.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 1 to 4.&mdash;<b>Cortinarius (Inoloma) violaceus</b> Fr. "<i>Violet Cortinarius</i>."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Edible.</span></p>

<p>Cap fleshy, at first convex, then nearly plane, dotted with hairy tufts or
scales, margin at first involute, color purple or dark violet, flesh soft,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4-19" id="Page_4-19">[Pg 4-19]</a></span>purplish; gills distant, broad, adnate, somewhat rounded near the stem,
at first purplish violet, changing to an ochraceous or brownish cinnamon
color as the plant matures; stem solid, somewhat bulbous at the base,
purple; cortina or veil white or tinged with violet, sometimes bluish.</p>

<p>This is a handsome species, and though it is somewhat rare in many
localities, its pretty and unusual coloring does not allow it to be easily
overlooked. It is edible, and has a mushroomy taste when raw. Agaricus
<i>nudus</i> Bull, a purple species with white spores, is sometimes confounded
with it. There are other purple species of Cortinarius not so
pleasant to the taste, which bear some resemblance to C. <i>violaceus</i>. The
specimens figured in <a href="#PLATE_XII">Plate XII</a> were gathered near Dedham, Mass., on
open ground on the border of a stretch of pine woods.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 5 to 7.&mdash;<b>Cortinarius (Phlegmacium) cærulescens</b>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Edible.</span></p>

<p>Cap fleshy, at first convex, then plane, surface even, viscid; color
bluish or violet; gills adnexed and crowded, at first bluish, changing
to violet or purplish hues; stem solid, short, and thick, with a broadly
bulbous base, same color as the cap; veil filmy, single. In woods and
on the borders of woods. This mushroom varies in color, the bluish or
purplish tints being quite susceptible to atmospheric changes. When
growing in the shade or well-sheltered places, it is much darker in hue
than when exposed unsheltered to the bright sunlight. The specimen
figured in <a href="#PLATE_XII">Plate XII</a> was gathered on low ground near a pine grove in
Essex County, Mass.</p>

<p>Cortinarius (Phlegmacium) <i>purpurascens</i> Fr. bears a slight resemblance
to <i>cærulescens</i>, but can be distinguished from it by the spotted or zoned
character of the cap and the broadly emarginate gills.</p>

<p>Cortinarius <i>turmalis</i>, an edible autumnal species, having an ochraceous
or brownish-yellow cap with emarginate or decurrent gills, the latter at
first whitish, then reddish clay color, is found in abundance in some parts
of Maryland. The gills are never tinged with purple or blue. The flesh
is white. The plants are easily discovered by those familiar with their
habitat, as they grow under pine needles in groups, forming small mounds
extending over large spaces, and in these hiding places, in the autumnal
months, they are free from insects and dust. I have collected a bushel
of them in less than an hour in fresh condition in October. Some of the
French authors do not class this species as edible. Gillet, in his Hymenomycetes
of France, enumerates fifty-three edible species of Cortinarius,
but places <i>turmalis</i> among the suspects. I find this mushroom not only
edible, but very valuable, because of its abundance in the localities where
found. It is often densely cæspitose. The plant, when mature, is from
3 to 5 inches high.</p>

<p>C. <i>sebæceus</i>, found also in pine woods, is recorded as edible. The plant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4-20" id="Page_4-20">[Pg 4-20]</a></span>is tall, white-stemmed, with broad tan-colored, somewhat viscid cap;
emarginate gills, clay color at first, at last cinnamon color; stem solid,
stout, fibrillose, and equal.</p>

<p>Cortinarius <i>collinitus</i>, Smeared Cortinarius, and Cortinarius <i>cinnamomeus</i>,
with its variety semi-sanguinea, have also been tested, and found
edible. The first of these is somewhat common. The plants when fresh
are covered with a glutinous substance, and this should be removed before
cooking. Cap smooth under the glutinous coat, light brown or tawny
yellow in color, flesh white; gills whitish or light gray when young, cinnamon-hued
in the matured plant. Stem solid, nearly equal, cylindrical,
yellowish, and somewhat scaly. C. <i>cinnamomeus</i> belongs to the division
Dermocybe. The cap is thin at first, silky with innate fibrids, becoming
smooth, and varies from light brown to a dark cinnamon color. The gills
are yellowish, then cinnamon; stem downy or silky, yellow. The variety
<i>semi-sanguinea</i> has the lamellæ red, almost as in the preceding species.</p>

<p>C. (Phlegmacium) <i>varius</i>, "Variable Cortinarius," edible, has a compact
fleshy viscid, even cap, brownish in color, gills at first violet, changing to
cinnamon, stout solid stem, white or whitish, adorned with adpressed
flocci, flesh white.</p>

<p>Cortinarius (Telamonia) <i>armillatus</i> Fries is given in M. C. Cooke's list
of edible Cortinarii. Cap fleshy but not thick, fibrillose and slightly
scaly, bright bay color, thin uneven margin; stem solid, dingy, rufescent,
showing irregular red zones or bands elongated and slightly bulbous at
the base; gills distant, broad, pallid in color at first, changing to dark
cinnamon. C. (Telamonia) <i>hæmatochelis</i> Bull. (edible), somewhat resembles
the former in color and size, though not so bright a brown. Cap
thin, silky-fibrillose; gills adnate, narrow and crowded, light cinnamon;
stem long, solid, dingy, with a reddish zone.</p>

<p>C. (Hydrocybe) <i>castaneus</i> Bull., <i>Chestnut Cortinarius</i> (edible), is found
in woods and gardens. The plants of this species are usually small.
Cap at first campanulate, expanding, sometimes slightly umbonate in the
centre, chestnut color; gills ventricose, crowded, purplish, changing to
rust color; stem short, hollow or stuffed, cartilaginous, equal, pallid, reddish
brown, or tinged with violet; veil white.</p>


<p style="margin-top:2em;"><i>Subgenus Collybia</i> Fries. Cap at first convex, then expanded, not depressed,
with an involute margin; gills reaching the stem, but not decurrent,
sometimes emarginate; stem hollow, with cartilaginous bark of a
different substance from the hymenophore, but confluent with it; often
swollen and splitting in the middle; spores white. The plants are usually
found growing upon dead tree stumps; some grow upon the ground; a
few are parasitic on other fungi or springing from <i>sclerotia</i>, small impacted
masses of mycelium. The species are generally small and firm
and of slow growth. A few are edible, some few have an unpleasant
odor. On account of the cartilaginous stem and the dryness of their
substance, some of the smaller species are apt to be taken for Marasmii.
Note: Saccardo in his Sylloge gives Collybia generic rank.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Edible.</span></p>

<p>Cap fleshy, somewhat tough, convex, then plane, smooth, even or
slightly cracked in places, umbo evanescent, reddish brown; gills adnexed,
nearly free, broad, distant, at length separating near the stem, firm, white,
changing to fawn color, or pale brown often spotted; stem long, stuffed,
then hollow, externally cartilaginous, contorted, swollen in the middle,
cracking in longitudinal slits, fusiform, tapering narrowly to a rooted
base, reddish brown. On stumps in woods in the autumn. Cap 1 to 2
inches broad; stem 2 to 6 inches long. This species is densely cæspitose.
It is very generally recorded among authors as edible, although the flesh
is somewhat tough. It requires long and slow cooking. An English
author recommends it for pickling. Only the caps should be used for
this purpose.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 4 to 6.&mdash;<b>Ag. (Collybia) maculatus</b> A. &amp; S. (<b>Collybia maculata</b>).
"<i>Spotted White Collybia</i>."</p>

<p>Cap fleshy and compact, convexo-plane, obtuse, smooth, even, margin
thin, at first involute, turned inwards, white; stem long and stout, externally
cartilaginous, ventricose, sometimes striate, tapering towards the
base; gills free, or nearly so, narrow, crowded, somewhat linear, white,
becoming spotted. Taste slightly acid. The whole plant is creamy white,
becoming spotted and stained throughout with rusty-brown or foxy-red
tints. The plants are usually large, long stemmed, and grow in irregular
clusters on decayed tree stumps in woods. Specimens of a large size
have been gathered in the fir woods near Mattapoisett, Massachusetts.
Cap 3 to 5 inches broad; stem 3 to 5 inches long. The variety <i>immaculatus</i>
differs from the typical form in not becoming spotted and in the
broader gills, which are serrated.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 7 to 9.&mdash;<b>Ag. (Collybia) velutipes</b> Curt. "<i>Velvet-Footed Collybia</i>."</p>

<p>Cap fleshy, thin, at first convex, then plane, obtuse, smooth, viscid,
tawny or brownish yellow, turning dark; flesh yellowish and soft; gills
slightly adnexed, pale yellow; stem tough, stuffed, externally cartilaginous,
sometimes slender, but usually thick, covered with a brown velvety
down, dark bay color. This is a very common species in some localities.
It is densely cæspitose, growing in heavy clusters on old logs and tree
trunks in parks, woods, and gardens. The plants are quite gelatinous
when cooked. Group figured from illustration by M. C. Cooke.</p>

<p>Collybia <i>radicata</i> Rehl. is recorded as an edible species. The plants
have a thin, slightly fleshy cap, slightly umbonate, wrinkled, and glutinous
at maturity; distant, white, adnexed gills, and tall, slender, rigid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4-22" id="Page_4-22">[Pg 4-22]</a></span>stem. The latter is often twisted and usually attenuated upwards, color
pale brown. It has a long tapering root entering deeply into the soil.
This species is solitary in habit, and is commonly found in grass, or near
decayed stumps. Cap from 2 to 3 inches in diameter, stem 6 inches to 10
inches in length.</p>

<p>Collybia <i>esculenta</i> Jacq., a small species found in pine woods as well as
in pastures in the spring, is recorded as edible by a number of authors.
In this species the cap is nearly plane, obtuse, and smooth, brownish;
gills adnate, whitish; stem very slender, fistulose, equal, tough, smooth,
reddish clay color, deeply rooting.</p>

<h1><a name="Appendix4"></a>APPENDIX.</h1>


<p>As Chief of the Division of Microscopy, U. S. Department of Agriculture,
the author prepared for the World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago a
collection of models of edible and poisonous mushrooms, for which a medal
and diploma were there awarded. The same collection, which now belongs
to the Museum of the Department of Agriculture, was exhibited
at the Atlanta Cotton Exposition in 1895, where a diploma was again
awarded for it, and has since been exhibited at the exposition of 1897 in
Nashville, Tenn. The models composing this collection, about one thousand
in number, were made from actual specimens and colored to nature,
the same species being generally represented by numerous specimens so
as to illustrate the various stages in the life of the plant, habit of growth,
etc.</p>

<p>Subgenus <i>Pleurotus</i> Fries. The Pleuroti are similar in some respects
to the Tricholomas and Clitocybes, some of the species having notched
gills near the stem, and others, again, having the gills decurrent, or running
down the stem. Most of the species grow upon dead wood or from
decaying portions of live trees. Very few grow upon the ground. The
stem is mostly eccentric, lateral, or wanting; when present it is homogeneous
or confluent with the substance of the cap; the substance may
be compact, spongy, slightly fleshy, or membranaceous. Veil evanescent
or absent. The spores are white or slightly tinted.</p>

<p>M. C. Cooke figures over thirty species of Pleurotus found in Great
Britain, and describes 45 species found in Australia. With few exceptions,
all of these grow upon wood. Very few have value as esculents.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Ag. (Pleurotus) ostreatus</b> Jacq. "<i>Oyster Mushroom</i>."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Edible.</span></p>

<p>Cap soft, fleshy, smooth, shell-shaped, white or cinereous, turning
brownish or yellowish with age. Flesh white, somewhat fibrous. Gills
white, broad and decurrent, anastamosing at the base. Stem usually not
well defined, lateral, or absent. Spores elliptical, white. The caps are
sometimes thickly clustered and closely overlapping, and sometimes wide
apart. This mushroom has long been known as edible both raw and
cooked. It has a pleasant but not decided flavor and must be cooked
slowly and carefully to be tender and easily digestible. Old specimens
are apt to be tough. It is found on decaying wood and often on fallen
logs in moist places or upon decaying tree-trunks. It is frequently recurrent
on the same tree. I have gathered great quantities of the Oyster
mushroom during several seasons past from a fallen birch tree which
spanned a small stream. The lower end of the tree rested on the moist
ground at the edge of the stream. Specimens have been found on the
willow, ash and poplar trees, and upon the apple and the laburnum.</p>


<p style="margin-top:2em;">Pleurotus <i>sapidus</i> Kalchb. <i>Sapid Pleurotus</i>. Edible.</p>

<p>This species closely resembles the Oyster mushroom in form and habit
of growth, and is by some considered only a variety of <i>P. ostreatus</i>. It
grows usually in tufts with the caps closely overlapping, varying in color
white, ashy, grayish or brownish. Flesh white. The stems are white,
smooth and short, mostly springing from a common base. The gills are
white and very broad, and decurrent. The spores assume a very pale
lilac tint on exposure to the atmosphere.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5-4" id="Page_5-4">[Pg 5-4]</a></span></p><p style="margin-top:2em;">Pleurotus <i>ulmarius</i> Bull. "<i>Elm Pleurotus</i>." Edible.</p>

<p>The Elm Pleurotus is quite conspicuous by reason of its large size and
light color. The cap is smooth and compact, usually whitish with a dull
yellowish tinge in the center. Flesh white. The skin cracks very easily,
giving it a scaly appearance. The gills are broad, and toothed or notched
near their point of attachment to the stem as in the Tricholomas, white in
color, turning yellowish with age. The stem is firm and smooth, solid
and rather eccentric, thick and sometimes slightly downy near the base,
from two to four inches in length. Although this mushroom seems to
prefer the elm and is most frequently found on trees of that species, it is
found also upon other trees, but principally the maple, the ash, the
willow, and the poplar. It grows upon live trees, usually where the
branches have been cut away, and upon stumps as well. Most authors
recommend it as an esculent, although it has not the rich flavor of some
other mushrooms. It dries well and can be kept thus for winter use.
This species has a wide range and grows most abundantly in the autumn.
Its resistance to cold has been frequently remarked.</p>




<p class="center">AGARICINI.</p>


<p>Subgenus <i>Amanita</i>. The Amanitas are usually large and somewhat
watery, the flesh brittle rather than tough. The very young plants are
enveloped in a membranous wrapper, which breaks apart with the expansion
of the plant, leaving a more or less persistent sheath at the base of
the stem. The universal veil is distinct and free from the cuticle of the
cap. The cap is convex at first, then expanded; in some species naked
and smooth; in others, clothed with membranaceous patches of the volva.
The stem is distinct from the fleshy substance of the cap, ringed and
furnished with a volva or sheath. In some of the species this sheath
is connate with the base of the stem, firm and persistent. In others, it
is friable, at length nearly obsolete.</p>

<p>The ring is usually persistent, deflexed, more or less prominent, in rare
cases pressed close against the stem, and sometimes scarcely distinguishable
from it. The gills in most of the species are free from the stems,
but there are exceptions to this rule. Spores white. As to geographical
distribution, according to M. C. Cooke, seven-eighths of the species
are distinctly located in the temperate zone, one-twentieth at a temperate
elevation, and only one-twentieth presumably tropical. Out of the eighty
species, about sixty are North American and European, and one species is
found on the slopes of the Andes, in South America. As heretofore
stated, this group among mushrooms is made responsible for most of
the well authenticated cases of fatal poisoning by mushrooms. It would
be judicious, therefore, for those who are not thoroughly familiar with the
characteristics of the edible Amanitas to defer making experiments with
them for table use until that familiarity is acquired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5-5" id="Page_5-5">[Pg 5-5]</a></span></p><p>Saccardo in his <i>Sylloge</i> describes no less than fifteen edible species of
Amanita as found in different parts of the world. Of those I have personally
been able to identify but three which are common in this country,
and which have been well tested. Specimens of these three species are
illustrated in Plates XIV and <a href="#PLATE_XIVH">XIV½</a> of this pamphlet. They are each and
all found in varying abundance in different parts of the United States.</p>

"<i>Orange Amanita</i>," "<i>True Orange</i>."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Edible.</span></p>

<p>Cap at first convex, afterwards well expanded; <i>smooth</i>, free from warts,
striate on the margin; color orange-red or bright lemon-yellow, with red
disk; gills lemon-yellow, rounded near the stem, and free from it; stem
equal or slightly tapering upwards, stuffed with cottony fibrils, or hollow
(color clear lemon-yellow), bearing a yellowish ring near the top and
sheathed at the base with large, loose, membranous, white volva. Odor
faint but agreeable. Spores white, elliptical.</p>

<p>The whole plant is symmetrical in form, brilliant in coloring, clean and
attractive in appearance. The American plant seems to differ in some
slight respects from the European as figured and described in European
works. In Europe the pileus or cap is said to vary in color, being sometimes
white, pale yellow, red or even copper color, although it is usually
orange-yellow. My own observation of the American plant of this species
agrees with that of Prof. Peck in that the cap is uniform in color, being
at first bright reddish-orange or even brilliant red, fading with age to
yellow, either wholly or only on the margin. No white specimens have
been as yet recorded in this country. The red color disappears in the
dried specimens. The striations of the margin are usually quite deep and
long and almost as distant as in the edible species Amanitopsis <i>vaginata</i>.
Some European writers have described the flesh or substance of the cap
as yellowish. In our plant the flesh is white, but stained with yellow or
red immediately under the cuticle. Amanita <i>Cæsarea</i> is the only one of
the Amanitas which has yellow gills.</p>

<p>Berkeley, in his "Outlines of British Fungi," describes A. Cæsarea as
it is found in some parts of Continental Europe, but states that up to the
date of his writing it had not been found in Great Britain. It is not recorded
in the more recent lists of British fungi by M. C. Cooke nor in
that of Australian fungi by the same author. The species has a wide
range in this country, and though not very common in the North, in some
localities, as in the pine and oak woods of North Carolina, it is found in
great abundance. Dufour states that it is much esteemed as an esculent
in France, and though rare in the northern part of that country, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5-6" id="Page_5-6">[Pg 5-6]</a></span>common in the center and the south of France in autumn. It is well
known in different portions of Continental Europe, and is frequently figured
in contrast with its very poisonous congener, Amanita muscaria, or
"False Orange," commonly known as the "Fly Amanita," or "Fly-Killer."</p>

<p>A careless observer might mistake one for the other, but with a little
attention to well-defined details the edible form can be readily distinguished
from the poisonous one.</p>

<p>In analyzing the species the attention should be directed to the following
characteristics of the two mushrooms: In A. <i>Cæsarea</i> the cap is
<i>smooth</i>, the stem, gills and ring <i>lemon-yellow</i>, and the cup-shaped wrapper
or volva which sheathes the base of the stem is white and <i>persistently
membranous</i>.</p>

<p>In A. <i>muscaria</i> the cap is <i>warty</i> or shows the traces or remains of
warts; the gills <i>white</i>, stem <i>white</i>, or only very slightly yellowish, and
the wrapper or volva is evanescent, breaking up into ridge-like patches
adhering to the base of the stem.</p>

<p>The Amanita Cæsarea has long been esteemed as an esculent in foreign
countries, and was known in ancient times to the Greeks and Romans.
It is known under the following names: "Orange," "Cæsar's mushroom,"
"Imperial mushroom," "Yellow-egg," "Kaiserling," etc. Mycologists
who have tested it agree as to its edibility and delicate flavor.</p>

<p>The specimens figured in <a href="#PLATE_XIV">Plate XIV</a> represent the average size of those
which I have gathered in the vicinity of the District of Columbia. Much
larger ones have been gathered in the woody portions of Druid Hill Park,
Baltimore, Md.</p>

<p>Dufour writes: "This mushroom, the "true oronge," is cooked in a
variety of ways, and it always constitutes an exquisite dish." This author
gives the following recipes for cooking the <i>Cæsarea</i>, which he calls the
"Oronge:"</p>

<p><i>Oronge à la bordelaise.</i>&mdash;The stem is minced with fine herbs, bread-crumbs,
and garlic, and seasoned with pepper and salt. This hash is
placed in the concavity of the caps, and all is put to bake with good oil
in a pan steamed in a chafing dish.</p>

<p><i>Oronge à l'Italienne.</i>&mdash;Stew gently with a little butter and salt, then
serve with a sauce composed of oil seasoned with the juice of lemon, pepper,
garlic, and extract of sweet almond.</p>

<p>The Spanish are fond of this mushroom, and it is said to enter into
their national dish, olla podrida, a mixture of meat, vegetables, and
spices, whenever it can be obtained.</p>

<p>It is sometimes fried in butter or olive oil and seasoned with sugar.</p>

"<i>The Blusher</i>," "<i>Reddish Brown Amanita</i>."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Edible.</span></p>

<p>Cap at first convex then expanded, margin even or very slightly
striated, usually reddish-brown or reddish-fawn color, covered with
mealy, more or loss persistent warts; flesh white, changing to a reddish
or pinkish tinge, where cut or bruised, the reddish tinge most intense in the
bulbous portion of the base of the stem; <i>gills reaching the stem and
forming decurrent lines upon it</i>, white, becoming spotted with rusty or
wine red stains when bruised or attacked by insects; stem ringed,
whitish or dingy white, becoming brownish or spotted, with reddish-brown
stains. The base of the stem is usually bulbous, the bulb sometimes
tapering to a point at the root, and in some instances ending
abruptly.</p>

<p>The ring or collar which encircles the stem near the top is membranous,
and usually well defined.</p>

<p>The volva which completely envelops the young plant is very friable
and soon disappears. Fragments of the volva may be seen in the shape
of scales or small particles upon the mushroom stem, and in wart-like
patches upon the cap. In the representations of this mushroom which
appear in European works the cap is a deeper reddish-brown tint than I have
found it here. The color of the cap is usually a light reddish brown or reddish
gray, sometimes almost white. This species is found usually in
light open woods. In a warm moist climate it appears early in the season,
and can be gathered until the frosts come. Taste very pleasant.</p>

<p>There is a poisonous species, Amanita <i>pantherinus</i>, rare, which has a
viscid brown warted cap bearing a slight resemblance to that of the
<i>rubescens</i>, but the gills do not turn red when bruised, and the volva at
the base of the stem is well defined and persistent.</p>

<p>The <i>rubescens</i> is very plentiful in the woods of Maryland and Virginia,
and specimens have been received from different parts of the country.
I have frequently eaten it stewed with butter, and found it very good
eating. Hay speaks of it as being eaten in England, where it is called
the "Blusher." Cooke says it is pleasant both in taste and odor. It is
spoken of by French authors as of delicate flavor, and as well known in
some parts of France. In preparing for the table bring the mushroom to
a quick boil and pour off the first water, then stew with flavoring to suit
the taste.</p>

<p>The specimens of this species represented in <a href="#PLATE_XIV">Plate XIV</a> were collected
in the woods of Forest Glen, Maryland. They are often found of much
larger size and much lighter in coloring, with the stains upon the gills
redder in color. The very young plants as they burst through the surface
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5-8" id="Page_5-8">[Pg 5-8]</a></span>of the soil show a distinct volva at the base of the stem. In the
mature plant this disappears, often leaving the slightly bulbous base
quite smooth.</p>

Agaricus (Amanita) strobiliformis, Vitt. "Fir-Cone Mushroom."<br />

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate XIV½.</span></p>

<p class="center"><b>Ag. (Amanita) strobiliformis</b> Fries (<b>Amanita strobiliformis</b>). "<i>Fir-cone Mushroom</i>."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Edible.</span></p>

<p>Cap fleshy, convex at first, then expanded, covered with persistent white
warts, margin even, white; flesh white, firm and compact; gills rounded
behind and free from the stem, white; stem solid, the bulbous base tapering,
furrowed with concentric and longitudinal channels at the root, and
extending well into the ground, white; ring large, soon splitting; volva
breaking up and appearing in concentric ridges upon the stem. Spores
white.</p>

<p>This mushroom is very pleasant to the taste when raw as well as when
cooked. It is found in light woods or on the borders of woods where the
soil is somewhat friable, generally solitary, but sometimes two or three
are found clustered together. The plants are sometimes so large that
two or three of them would make a very good meal. Specimens have
been found with the cap measuring 8 to 9 inches across when expanded,
the stem varying from 6 to 8 inches in height, and from 1 to 3 inches in
thickness. When young the plants are generally snowy white throughout,
changing with age to a dingy white or cinereous hue. The specimens
figured in the plate formed one of a cluster of three mushrooms of this
species found growing in the fir woods of the District of Columbia.</p>

<p>During some seasons I have found the <i>strobiliformis</i>, or "Fir-cone
mushroom," fairly plentiful in some parts of Maryland, and in other seasons
it has been rare. The whole plant when young is enclosed in a white
membranous wrapper.</p>

<p>Although this species is very generally recognized by mycologists as
edible, I would advise great caution in selecting specimens for table use,
since there is a dangerous species which might be mistaken for it by one
not familiar with the characteristics of both species; I refer to a form of
Amanita muscaria with ochraceous yellow cap which, when faded or
bleached by the sun and rain, sometimes approaches, in tint, the dingy
white of old or faded specimens of the <i>strobiliformis</i>. Both species have
<i>white gills</i>, <i>white stems</i>, and <i>white flocculent veil</i>. The volva is evanescent
in both, leaving traces of its existence in concentric ridges at the base,
and part way up the stem.</p>

<p>In the species <i>strobiliformis</i>, the flesh of the cap is white throughout,
as well as the cuticle.</p>

<p>In the yellowish <i>muscaria</i>, the flesh <i>immediately</i> beneath the cuticle
of the upper surface of the cap is yellowish, frequently deepening at the
disk to orange hue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5-9" id="Page_5-9">[Pg 5-9]</a></span></p><p>The cap of Amanita <i>muscaria</i> is very attractive to flies, but proves to
them, as also to roaches and to some other insects, a deadly poison.</p>

<p>The juice of <i>strobiliformis</i> is not poisonous to flies. This fact may aid
in identifying the species.</p>


<p style="margin-top:2em;">Subgenus <i>Amanitopsis</i> Roze. The species of this subgenus were formerly
included in Amanita. The characteristic which separates it from
Amanita is the <i>absence of a ring on the stem</i>. The gills are free from the
stem, the spores are white, and the whole plant in youth is encased in
an egg-shaped volva.<a name="FNanchor_A_3" id="FNanchor_A_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_3" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_3" id="Footnote_A_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_3"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Although this subgenus is not included in M. C. Cooke's analytical key to the order
of Agaricini, published with his kind permission in No. 3 of this series, he now includes
it as one of the subgenera which should have a place in that list.</p></div>


<p style="margin-top:2em;">Amanitopsis <i>vaginata</i> Roze. Edible.</p>

<p>This species is very common in pine and oak forests. The plant, as a
whole, has a graceful aspect and grows singly or scattered through open
places in the woods. It is somewhat fragile and easily broken. The cap
in this species is usually a mouse-gray, sometimes slaty gray or brownish,
generally umbonate in the center and distinctly striated on the margin.</p>

<p>The stem is white, equal, and slender in proportion to the width of the
cap, and sheathed quite far up with a loose white membranous wrapper.
This sheath is so slightly attached to the base of the stem that it is often
left in the ground if the plant is carelessly pulled. The gills are white,
or whitish, free from the stem and rounded at the outer extremity.</p>

<p>There is a white variety, (variety <i>alba</i>) A. <i>nivalis</i>, in which the whole
plant is white, and a tawny variety (A. <i>fulva</i> Schaeff.) in which the cap is
a pale ochraceous yellow, with the gills and stem white or whitish. In
the variety A. <i>livida</i> or A. <i>spadicea</i> Grev. the cap is brown, while the
stem and gills are tinged a smoky brown.</p>

<p>These are all edible and of fairly good flavor. Except in the absence of
the ring upon the stem, the light varieties might be mistaken for small
forms of the poisonous species Amanita <i>verna</i> or of <i>phalloides</i>. Great
caution should therefore be observed, in gathering for the table, to be sure
of the species.</p>

<p>Cap warty, margin striate; gills white, reaching the stem, and often
forming decurrent lines upon it; stem white, stuffed, annulate, bulbous at
the base, concentrically ridged or scaly at the base, and sometimes part
way up, with fragments of the ruptured wrapper. Spores widely elliptical,
white, .0003 to .0004 of an inch in length.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5-10" id="Page_5-10">[Pg 5-10]</a></span></p><p>The plants of this species vary very much in size and in the color of the
cap. The latter is sometimes a bright scarlet and again it is orange color,
more frequently ochraceous yellow, fading to a very pale yellow tint. In
the variety <i>albus</i> it is white. The stem is stuffed with webby fibrils and
varies very much in thickness: sometimes in young specimens it is very
stout, with a thick ovate bulb reaching well up towards the cap, and
again it is comparatively slender and nearly equal from the cap down to
a very slight bulb at the base. The very young plant is completely enveloped
in a white or yellowish egg-shaped wrapper or volva, which, being
friable, generally breaks up into scales, forming warts upon the upper
surface of the cap. When the plant is young and moist the cap is slightly
sticky. A thickish white veil extends from the stem to the inner margin
of the cap. This breaks away with the growth and expansion of the plant
and falls in lax folds, forming a deflexed ring round the upper portion of
the stem.</p>

<p>This mushroom is very common in woods and forests in summer
and autumn, and has a wide geographical range. It is recorded by all
mycologists as poisonous. One author states that when eaten in very
small quantities it acts as a cathartic, but that it causes death when eaten
freely. Flies find in it a deadly poison, and the poisonous alkaloids are
not destroyed by drying.</p>

<p>Although cases are cited where this mushroom has been eaten without
injury, its fatally poisonous effects have been too well and too often tested
to allow of any doubt as to the danger of eating it, even in small quantities.</p>

<p>Amanita Frostiana, Frost's Amanita, is a much smaller species than A.
muscaria. It bears a very close resemblance to the Fly Amanita, and
might easily be taken for a small form of the same. The cap is yellowish
and warted, and specimens occur in which the stem and gills are slightly
tinged with yellow. It is poisonous.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Poisonous.</span></p>

<p>Cap bell-shaped or ovate at first, then expanded, smooth, obtuse, viscid,
margin even, creamy-white, brown, or greenish, without warts; flesh
white; stem white, hollow or stuffed, bulbous at the base, annulate;
gills rounded and ventricose, coarse, and persistently white, free from the
stem; volva conspicuous, large, loose, adhering to the base, but free from
the stem at the top, with the margin irregularly notched. In the white
forms there is frequently a greenish or yellow tinge at the disk or centre
of the cap. The white form is most common, but the brownish is often
found in this country. I have not yet found the green-capped variety sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5-11" id="Page_5-11">[Pg 5-11]</a></span>figured in European works. In the brown variety the stem and
ring are often tinged with brown, as also the volva. The cap is usually
from 2 to 3 inches broad, and the stem from 3 to 5 inches long. The
whole plant is symmetrical in shape and clean looking, though somewhat
clammy to the touch when moist. It is very common in mixed woods,
in some localities, and is universally considered as fatally poisonous.</p>

<p>The white form of A. <i>phalloides</i>, although in reality bearing very little
resemblance to the common field mushroom, has been mistaken for it as
also for the <i>Smooth white lepiota</i>, and in some instances has been eaten
with fatal results by those who gathered it.</p>

<p>The distinction between this most poisonous Amanita and the common
field mushroom is well marked. In the common mushroom the <i>gills</i> are
<i>pink, becoming dark brown</i>, the <i>spores purplish brown</i>, and the whole
mushroom is stout and short stemmed, the stem being shorter than the
diameter of the cap, and having no volva, or wrapper at its base. In the
species A. <i>phalloides</i> the <i>gills</i> are <i>persistently white</i> and the bulb is distinct
and broad at the base, the white cup-shaped wrapper sheathing the
base of the stem like the calyx of a flower. The <i>Smooth white lepiota</i>
shows neither volva nor trace of one, and has other distinct characteristics
which distinguish it from A. <i>phalloides</i>. See <a href="#Page_4-14">page 14, No. 4</a> of this series.</p>

<p>The specimen figured in <a href="#PLATE_XV">Plate XV</a> grew in Maryland, where it is quite
common.</p>

<h1><a name="Alkaloids"></a>ALKALOIDS OF THE POISONOUS MUSHROOMS.</h1>


<p>Schrader, after some experiments made in 1811, stated that the poisonous
principle of the "Fly mushroom," Amanita muscaria, seemed to be
combined with its red coloring matter and might be extracted by water
or aqueous alcohol, but that it was not soluble in ether.</p>

<p>Vaquelin, as the result of more extended investigations made in 1813,
expressed the opinion that this poison was not confined to the coloring
matter of the mushroom, but that it was an integral part of the fatty
constituents not only of <i>muscaria</i> but of several species of mushrooms.
In 1826 and 1830, and again in 1867, important investigations were made
and published by Letellier relating to the medical and poisonous properties
of mushrooms growing around Paris. Letellier's early investigations
led him to the conclusion that there were two poisons contained in certain
fungi&mdash;(1) an acrid principle easily destroyed by drying or boiling or
by maceration in alcohol or in alkaline solution, and (2) a peculiar poisonous
alkaloid found only in certain of the Amanita group. Letellier in
1866 named this latter alkaloid <i>amanitin</i>. He then considered it to be the
active poison of Amanita <i>muscaria</i>, Amanita <i>phalloides</i>, and Amanita
<i>verna</i>, but a subsequent analysis by the German chemists Schmiedeberg
and Koppe showed the <i>amanitin</i> of Letellier to be identical with <i>cholin</i>,
a substance found in bile. Kobert says that <i>amanitin</i> is non-poisonous
in itself, but states that it may be changed on decay of the mushroom to
the muscarin-like acting <i>neurin</i>, which is highly poisonous. He thinks
it highly probable that nearly all of the edible and non-edible mushrooms
contain pure <i>amanitin</i> (cholin) partly in primitive condition and partly in a
more intricate organic connection, as <i>lecithin</i>. It has been demonstrated
that amanitin separates very readily from lecithin during the <i>decay or
careless drying</i> of mushrooms and changes into the <i>poisonous neurin</i>;
hence the necessity of using mushrooms only when <i>perfectly fresh</i> or
when <i>quickly dried</i>.</p>


<h2><a name="Muscarin"></a><span class="smcap">Muscarin.</span><a name="FNanchor_A_4" id="FNanchor_A_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_4" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></h2>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_4" id="Footnote_A_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_4"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> The earliest account of the separation of the poisonous principles of the mushrooms
of the genus Amanita dates back to the experiments of Apoiger in 1851.
Harnack's researches were published in 1876 and those of Huseman in 1882.</p></div>

<p>To the eminent German chemists Schmiedeberg and Koppe is due
the credit of isolating the active poisonous principle of the Fly mushroom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5-13" id="Page_5-13">[Pg 5-13]</a></span>(<i>muscarin</i>). These authors published in 1869 a series of interesting
experiments made with <i>muscarin</i>, having relation to its effect upon
the heart, respiration, secretions and digestive organs, etc., and this was
supplemented by other experiments made by their pupils, Prof. R. Boehm
and E. Harnack. Schmiedeberg and Koppe's work relates to the effect of
this poison on man as well as upon the lower animals. Dr. J. L. Prevost
in 1874 reviewed the investigations made by Schmiedeberg and Koppe in
a paper read before the Biological Society of Geneva, adding some confirmatory
observations of his own relative to experiments made with muscarin
upon the lower animals. The experiments made by these authors
demonstrated "that muscarin arrests the action of a frog's heart, that a
muscarined frog's heart began to beat immediately under the influence of
atropin, and further that it was impossible to muscarine a frog's heart
while under the influence of atropin."</p>

<p>Schmiedeberg subjected cats and dogs to doses of muscarin, large
enough to produce death, and when the animals were about to succumb,
injected hypodermically from one to two milligrams of sulphate of
<i>atropin</i>, after which the toxic symptoms disappeared and the animals
completely revived. Prof. Boehm found that <i>digitalin</i> likewise re-established
heart action when suspended by the action of muscarin.</p>

<p>In man the fatal termination, in cases of mushroom poisoning, where
the antidote is not used, may take place in from 5 to 12 hours or not for
two or three days.</p>

<p>According to Prof. E. Kobert's recent chemical analysis, the "Fly
mushroom," Amanita muscaria, contains not only the very poisonous
alkaloid <i>muscarin</i> and the <i>amanitin</i> of Letellier (<i>cholin</i>), but also a
third alkaloid, <i>pilz atropin</i>. The pilz-atropin (mushroom atropin) was
discovered by Schmiedeberg in a <i>commercial</i> preparation of <i>muscarin</i>,
and later Prof. Kobert discovered it in varying proportions in fresh mushrooms
of different species. The effect of this third alkaloid, it is claimed,
is to neutralize to a greater or less extent the effect of the poisonous one.
Under its influence, when present in quantity, the poison is almost entirely
neutralized. Contraction of the pupils changes to dilation, and
slowing of the pulse may disappear. Only through the presence of this
natural antidote in the Fly mushroom, says Kobert, is it possible, as in
some parts of France and Russia, to eat without danger this mushroom,
which contains 10% of sugar (trehalose or mycose) in a fermented and
unfermented condition. He states also that delirium, intoxication, and
other symptoms which, according to Prof. Dittmer of Kamschatka and various
scientific travellers, are reported effects of the Fly mushroom in the extreme
north, are not experienced in the same degree in southern Russia.
This difference in action, he thinks, may be very properly attributed to the
varying proportion of the above-mentioned atropin in the mushroom or
to the presence of substances which develop only in the extreme north.</p>

<p>The symptoms of <i>muscarin</i> poisoning, apart from vomiting and purging,
are slowing of the pulse, cerebral disturbance, contraction of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5-14" id="Page_5-14">[Pg 5-14]</a></span>pupils, salivation and sweating. In case of death, which is caused by
suffocation or a suspension of heart action, the lungs are found to be
filled with air, and there is a transfusion of blood in the alimentary canal.</p>

<p>Prof. R. Kobert, in a lecture delivered before the University of Dorpat in
1891, states that <i>muscarin</i> is found equally in the Fly mushroom (A. muscaria),
the Panther mushroom (A. pantherinus), Boletus luridus, and in
varying quantities in Russula emetica. He states also that though
highly poisonous to vertebrates, <i>muscarin</i> is not so to flies, and that the
noxious principle in A. muscaria which kills the flies is not as yet determined.</p>

<p>It has been shown that the lower animals, such as sheep and geese, as
well as man, have been severely poisoned by feeding on the "Fly mushroom,"
and that in the case of the horse, experiments have demonstrated
that even 0.04 of a gramme, 0.62 of a grain, have caused marked symptoms
of poisoning.</p>

<p>For <i>muscarin</i> as for <i>neurin</i> poisoning the antidote is atropin administered
internally or by subcutaneous injection.</p>


<h2><a name="Phallin"></a><span class="smcap">Phallin.</span></h2>

<p>The toxic alkaloid of Amanita <i>phalloides</i> Fries (Amanita <i>bulbosa</i>)
was examined by Boudier, who named it "<i>bulbosin</i>," and by Oré, who
named it "<i>phalloidin</i>," but their examinations, it is claimed, proved little
beyond the fact that it seemed to be in the nature of an alkaloid, identical
neither with <i>muscarin</i> nor <i>helvellic</i> acid.</p>

<p>Oré affirmed that the <i>phalloidin</i> of the Amanita phalloides was very
nearly related to, and perhaps identical with, strychnine. From this view
Kobert and others dissent.</p>

<p>The poisonous principle of Amanita <i>phalloides</i> has recently been subjected
to very careful analysis by Prof. Kobert. As a result of a large
number of experiments and post-mortem examinations held on persons
poisoned by A. <i>phalloides</i>, Kobert states that the symptoms can be explained
uniformly by the action of a poison, to which he gives the provisional
name of "<i>phallin</i>." This is an albuminous substance which dissolves
the corpuscles of the blood, resembling in this and other respects
in a remarkable degree the action of <i>helvellic</i> acid.</p>

<p>According to Kobert <i>phallin</i> has so far only been found in Amanita <i>phalloides</i>
and in its varieties <i>verna</i>, <i>mappa</i>, etc. He finds also in this mushroom
muscarin and an atropin-like alkaloid.</p>

<p>The symptoms of the phalloides poisoning are complex. Vomiting is
accompanied by diarrh&oelig;a, cold sweats, fainting at times, convulsions, ending
in coma. There is also fever and a quickening of the pulse. All these
symptoms, which follow in succession, according to one author, are dependent
on two different poisonous substances. The first may be an acrid and
fixed poison, for it is found after repeated dryings, as well in the aqueous
as in the alcoholic extract. The second acts by absorption, and is purely
narcotic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5-15" id="Page_5-15">[Pg 5-15]</a></span></p><p>Phallin has some of the properties of the toxalbumin of poisonous
spiders, and is a vegetable toxalbumin.</p>

<p>It has been remarked that in cases of poisoning by A. <i>phalloides</i>, the
mushroom has tasted very good, and those poisoned felt well for several
hours after eating.</p>

<p>Phalloides poisoning is said to bear a marked resemblance to phosphorus
poisoning and to acute jaundice. There is no known antidote to the
poisonous alkaloid <i>phallin</i>.</p>

<p>According to Prof. Kobert's analyses, the proportion of phallin in the
dried mushroom amounts to less than 1%, but its effect on account of its
concentration is the more intensive.</p>

<p>Extensive experiments made by Kobert with ox blood in regard to the
comparative action of different substances in their power of dissolving
the red blood corpuscles demonstrate that <i>phallin</i> in this respect exceeds
all known substances. Kobert states that "If <i>phallin</i> be added to a mixture
of blood with a 1% solution of common salt, using the blood of man,
cattle, dogs, or pigeons, the blood corpuscles will be entirely dissolved by
the poison diluted to 1-125,000."</p>

<p>Prof. Kobert states that he has examined the species Boletus edulis,
Agaricus campester, and Amanita Cæsarea a number of times, but could
never detect the action of phallin in them. Neither has he found it in A.
muscaria.</p>


<h2><a name="Gyromitra"></a><span class="smcap">The Poisonous Alkaloid of Gyromitra esculenta Fries</span> (<span class="smcap">Helvella esculenta
Pers.</span>)</h2>

<h3><a name="Helvellic"></a><span class="smcap">Helvellic Acid.</span></h3>

<p>Prof. Kobert writes of a number of cases of poisoning in the Baltic
provinces of Russia by the mushroom Helvella <i>esculenta</i> Persoon, sometimes
called the Lorchel. It should be here stated that the <i>Helvella
esculenta</i> of Persoon is the <i>Gyromitra esculenta</i> of Fries. This mushroom
is described as edible and placed in the edible lists by Dr. M. C.
Cooke, Prof. Peck, and other distinguished mycologists, who have tested
it and found it edible when perfectly fresh.</p>

<p>The poisonous principle of this mushroom was isolated and analyzed
by Prof. R. Boehm, of Russia, in 1885. It was by him designated
as "<i>helvellic acid</i>," and found to be soluble in hot water. Profs. Eugene
Bostroem and E. Ponfick, after giving some study to the effects of this
mushroom poison, agreed in their report concerning it, which is to the
effect that the <i>quickly dried</i> H. <i>esculenta</i> (Gyromitra <i>esculenta</i>) is not
poisonous, and that the poisonous acid of the fresh ones may be extracted
by means of hot water, so that while the decoction is poisonous the
mushroom is not at all so, after the liquid is pressed out. Experiments
with this mushroom were made by both authors on dogs, which ate them
greedily, but without exception the dogs were very sick afterwards. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5-16" id="Page_5-16">[Pg 5-16]</a></span>symptoms were nausea, vomiting, jaundice, stoppage of the kidneys, and
hæmaglobinuria. The symptoms observed in man correspond to those
manifested by the lower animals. Dissection showed the dissolution of
innumerable blood corpuscles.</p>

<p>Prof. Kobert, commenting on the experiments made by Bostroem and
Ponfick, states that he himself had been furnished yearly with fresh
specimens of "H. <i>esculenta</i>" (G. <i>esculenta</i>) specially gathered for him at
Dorpat, and after making various experiments with the freshly expressed
juice he became convinced that the poisonous principle greatly varies,
the juice sometimes operating as very poisonous, and sometimes as only
slightly so. He states also that the proportion of poison in the mushroom
varies with the weather, location, and age of the mushroom. The
inhabitants of Russia do not eat this mushroom, but in Germany it is
eaten dried or when perfectly fresh, after cooking, and after the first
water in which it is boiled is removed.</p>

<p>Helvellic acid is not found in Morchella <i>esculenta</i> (the true Morel), nor
is it known to exist in any other species except G. <i>esculenta</i>. It has been
stated that there is no antidote for helvellic poisoning after the symptoms
have appeared.</p>

<p>A specimen of Gyromitra esculenta was forwarded to me from Portland,
Maine, by a member of a mycological club of that city, who
stated that this mushroom was quite abundant in the early spring in the
woods near Portland and that the plants were eaten by the members of
the club, <i>care being taken to use them only when perfectly fresh</i>. Indigestion
and nausea followed the eating of old specimens, but the general
opinion was "favorable to the Gyromitra as an addition to the table."
(See <a href="#Page_2-6">page 6, part 2</a>, of this series.)</p>

<p>Prof. Chas. H. Peck, of Albany, while placing this mushroom in his
edible list as one which he had repeatedly tested, advises that it should be
eaten only when perfectly fresh, as nausea and sickness had been known
to result from the eating of specimens which had been kept twenty-four
hours before cooking.</p>

<p>I forwarded a number of drawings of the American species of G. <i>esculenta</i>,
together with a dried specimen of the same received from Maine, to
Prof. Kobert, who identified both drawings and specimen as the <i>Gyromitra
esculenta</i> of Fries, synonymous with the <i>Helvella esculenta</i> of Persoon.
Prof. Kobert also informs me that he finds the fresh G. <i>esculenta</i> perfectly
harmless when freed of the water of the first boiling. He says: "My
wife and I eat it very often, when in fresh condition, and after the first
water in which it is boiled is poured off." The active poisonous principle
of this mushroom is the <i>helvellic acid</i>, which is soluble in hot water.
When the mushroom is gathered fresh and <i>quickly dried</i> it is then also
innoxious. In this respect it differs from the species <i>A. muscaria</i>, in
which the poisonous alkaloid <i>muscarin</i> is not destroyed in the drying, but
remains unchanged for years in the dried mushroom.</p>

<p>The fact that there have been seemingly well-authenticated cases of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5-17" id="Page_5-17">[Pg 5-17]</a></span>fatal poisoning in the eating of this mushroom shows that if used at all it
should be eaten <i>only when the conditions essential to safety are most carefully
observed</i>, and as these mushrooms show varying qualities, according
to local conditions of soil and climate, etc., amateurs finding it in localities
where it has not been heretofore used should proceed tentatively and
with much care before venturing to eat it freely.</p>


<h2><a name="Deleterious"></a><span class="smcap">Poisonous and Deleterious Mushrooms of the Lactar, Russula, and
Boletus Groups</span>.</h2>

<p>Lactarius <i>torminosus</i> Fries contains in its milky juice an acrid resin
which causes inflammation of the stomach and of the alimentary canal.
When parboiled and the first water removed, it has been eaten without
injurious effects. Lactarius <i>plumbeus</i> Bull., Lactarius <i>uvidus</i> Fries, Lactarius
<i>turpis</i> Weinn., and Lactarius <i>pyrogalus</i> Bull., all acrid mushrooms,
according to Kobert, are similarly poisonous.</p>

<p>Of the "Erdschieber" (Lactarius <i>vellereus</i>) and the "Pfefferling"
(Lactarius piperatus Scop.) Kobert says they are eaten in parts of Russia
and in some places in Germany, but that neither is very safe.</p>

<p style="margin-top:2em;">There is a species of <i>Russula</i> (R. <i>emetica</i>) very common in woods, easily
recognized by its smooth scarlet top, white gills, and white stem and by
its biting acridity, which, though recorded as poisonous by some authors,
is considered edible by others. This mushroom, R. <i>emetica</i>, has been
subjected to chemical analysis by Kobert, who finds in it <i>muscarin</i>, <i>cholin</i>,
and <i>pilz-atropin</i> in varying proportions. Kobert states that in Germany
it is "<i>rightly</i>" considered poisonous, though eaten in Russia, and ascribes
the fact that it is not deemed poisonous in the latter country to the manner
in which it is there prepared, the poisonous alkaloid being in greater
part eliminated by parboiling the mushrooms, and not merely pouring off
the water, but carefully squeezing it out of the parboiled fungi.</p>

<p>To the presence in this mushroom of the neutralizing alkaloid "pilz-atropin"
in varying proportions may also be attributed in some measure
the safety with which it has been eaten under certain conditions. R.
f&oelig;tens and other acrid Russulas, as well as Lactars, have been known to
produce severe gastro-enteritis.</p>

<p>Considering the foregoing, it would seem the part of prudence at least
to avoid such of the Lactars and Russulas as have an acrid or peppery
taste.</p>

<p>I think it would be a wise precaution to pour off the water of the first
boiling in the case of all mushrooms about which there is a particle of
doubt, whether <i>recorded</i> as poisonous or not.</p>

<p>Lactarius <i>torminosus</i> Fries. Cap fleshy, at first convex, then expanded,
at length depressed in the center, slightly zoned, margin turned inwards,
pale ochraceous yellow, with flesh-colored mottlings; <i>downy</i> or <i>hairy</i>;
gills whitish, changing to pinkish yellow, narrow and close together; stem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5-18" id="Page_5-18">[Pg 5-18]</a></span>equal, stuffed or hollow, pallid or whitish; milk persistently <i>white and
acrid</i>. In woods and fields. Specimens have been collected in New
York, Massachusetts, Maryland, and Virginia. Cap 3 to 5 inches, stem 2½
to 4 inches.</p>

<p>Lactarius <i>pyrogalus</i>. Cap fleshy, slightly zoned, <i>smooth</i>, even, and
moist, depressed in the center, grayish, or cinereous; gills white or yellowish,
thin, not crowded; stem short, stout, stuffed, or hollow, sometimes
slightly attenuated towards the root, pallid; flesh white or whitish;
milk <i>white</i> and <i>extremely acrid</i>, copious. Borders of woods and meadows.
This mushroom is sometimes called the "Fiery Milk Mushroom."</p>

<p>Lactarius <i>uvidus</i> Fries. Cap thin, convex, then plane, and slightly
depressed in the center, sometimes showing slight umbo, viscid, <i>zoneless</i>,
smooth, dingy gray or pallid brown, margin turned inwards; gills
narrow and close together, white or yellowish, when cut or bruised turning
a purplish hue; stem stuffed or hollow, viscid, smooth, equal or slightly
tapering towards the cap, white; milk white, changing to lilac, acrid.
Height 2 to 4 inches. Cap 2 to 4 inches broad. In woods.</p>

<p>Lactarius <i>turpis</i> Fries. Cap viscid, compact, <i>zoneless</i>, greenish umber,
margin clothed with yellowish down; gills thin, paler than the cap; stem
hollow or stuffed, stoutish, short, viscid, olive color, slightly attenuated
towards the base; milk <i>white</i>, <i>acrid</i>. Fir woods.</p>

<p>Lactarius <i>plumbeus</i> Fries. Cap fleshy, firm, dry, somewhat hairy, varying
in color, usually some shade of brown; gills yellowish, thin, and close
together; stem solid, equal, lighter in color than the cap; flesh white;
milk <i>white</i> and <i>acrid</i>.</p>

<p>Lactarius <i>vellereus</i> Fries. <i>Fleecy Lactarius</i>. Cap compact, convex or
umbilicate, zoneless, <i>minutely downy</i>; margin reflexed, gills white, <i>distant</i>,
arcuate; stem short, solid, pubescent; milk <i>white</i>, <i>acrid</i>, somewhat
scanty. In woods. Whole plant white.</p>

<p>Lactarius <i>piperatus</i> Scop. <i>Peppery Lactarius</i>. Cap fleshy, compact,
convex and slightly umbilicate, at last deeply depressed, becoming funnel-formed,
smooth and even; gills decurrent, very narrow, thin, even and
close together, dichotonous, white; flesh white; milk <i>white</i>, <i>extremely
acrid</i>, copious; stem very short, stout, solid. Whole plant white.</p>

<p>Lactarius <i>blennius</i> Fries. Cap depressed, slimy or glutinous, greenish-gray;
margin incurved and somewhat downy. Gills narrow, white or
whitish; stem stuffed or hollow, viscid, and of same color as the cap or
paler; milk white and very acrid.</p>

<p>M. C. Cooke divides the genus Lactarius into 4 "Tribes": (1) Piperites,
in which the stem is central, gills <i>unchangeable</i>, naked, neither discolored
nor <i>pruinose</i>, milk at first <i>white</i> and <i>commonly acrid</i>; (2) Dapetes, in
which the stem is central, gills naked, <i>milk from the first deeply colored</i>;
(3) Russulares, in which the stem is central, gills pallid, <i>then discolored</i>,
becoming darker, changing when turned to the light, at length <i>pruinose</i>,
with milk at <i>first white</i> and <i>mild</i> and <i>sometimes becoming acrid</i>; (4)
Pleuropos, in which the stem is concentric or lateral.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5-19" id="Page_5-19">[Pg 5-19]</a></span></p><p>To the first of these subdivisions, <i>Piperites</i>, belong all of the Lactars
enumerated above. The Russians eat the Piperites only after the water
of the first boiling has been taken off.</p>

<p>Lactarius <i>rufus</i> Scop., a very acrid species of large size, having reddish
ochraceous gills and zoneless cap of reddish yellow with white milk,
belongs to the subdivision Russulares. Common in fir woods. Dangerous.</p>

<p>Lactarius <i>volemus</i> Fries, a tawny yellow-capped mushroom with white
gills changing to a yellowish hue, and copious <i>sweet</i> white milk, belongs
also to the latter subdivision. Edible.</p>

<p>Russula (Fragiles) <i>emetica</i> Fries. Cap fleshy, at first convex, then
expanded or depressed, smooth, polished, red, margin sulcate; gills free,
equal and broad, white; stem solid but somewhat spongy in the center,
smooth, short, stoutish, white or stained reddish; flesh white, sometimes
slightly tinted red, under the thin red cuticle. The cap of this mushroom
varies from a deep rich crimson to a pale pinkish red, being very
subject to atmospheric changes. Specimens are often found with the
cap washed almost white after heavy rains, or with but a slight red spot
in the center. The gills and spores are pure white, and the flesh peppery
to the taste. If tasted when raw the juice should not be swallowed.</p>

<p>The variety <i>Clusii</i> has a blood-red cap, pallid yellowish gills, adnexed,
becoming adnate. Spores white. In woods. Acrid. The variety <i>fallax</i>
is fragile, with dingy reddish pileus and adnexed, distant, whitish gills.</p>

<p>Besides the above mentioned, there are other acrid Russulas and Lactars
which are regarded with suspicion, though not as yet satisfactorily
tested.</p>


<h3><a name="Boleti"></a><span class="smcap">Poisonous Boleti.</span></h3>

<p>Several of the Boleti have the reputation of being poisonous or deleterious,
among them Boletus <i>luridus</i>, Boletus <i>Satanas</i>, and Boletus <i>felleus.</i>
Kobert's analysis of B. <i>luridus</i> shows the presence of the poisonous alkaloid
muscarin in this mushroom, while the bitterness of B. <i>felleus</i> should
make one chary of eating it in quantity, if at all. Schmiedeberg and
Koppe describe experiments made with Boletus Satanas, in which the
symptoms experienced closely resemble those of muscarin poisoning.</p>

<p>A correspondent living in Georgia, who is quite familiar with the species,
writes that he has frequently eaten the yellow form of the <i>muscaria</i>, when
cooked, without serious inconvenience. Another correspondent writes that
he has eaten the species Boletus luridus and Boletus Satanas, as well as
several other mushrooms of poisonous repute, with perfect impunity.</p>

<p>Without calling in question the testimony of persons who state that
they have with impunity eaten mushrooms generally found to be poisonous,
it must be said that even if, through local conditions of soil or
climate, the poisonous constituents of such mushrooms sometimes exist
in comparatively minute proportions, or are <i>neutralized</i> by an unusual
proportion of <i>mushroom atropin</i> in the plant, or eliminated by some
process used in its preparation for the table, or, finally, if constitutional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5-20" id="Page_5-20">[Pg 5-20]</a></span>idiosyncrasies should enable some persons safely to eat what is poisonous
to others, the rule that such are to be avoided should never be disregarded
by the ordinary collector, nor should it be departed from even by
experts, except upon the clearest evidence that in the given case the departure
is safe. It is certainly the part of discretion, when in doubt, to
take no risks.</p>


<h2><a name="Poisoning"></a><span class="smcap">Recent Instances of Mushroom Poisoning.</span></h2>

<p>About a year ago a physician in Vineland, New Jersey, furnished the
following in regard to his personal experience of the effects of mushroom
poisoning: "My wife, daughter, and self selected, according to an article
in the Encyclopedia Britannica, what we thought were a nice lot of mushrooms,
cooked them in milk, and ate them for dinner with relish. In a
few hours we were vomiting, laughing, and staggering about the house.
We could not control ourselves from the elbows to the finger tips, nor
our legs from the knee to the ends of our toes. In other words, we were
drunk on mushrooms. The mushrooms grew within the shade of Norway
spruce and other ornamental trees on the lawn in front of our house.
They were pure white inside and out; smooth shiny tops that easily
peeled off. The caps were about two or three inches in diameter, and
had a stem of the same length. On the day before, my wife and a friend
ate some of these mushrooms raw and experienced no bad effects. The
next day at noon we ate them cooked in milk with a little butter, and
they were very good. About two o'clock our food did not seem to digest
well, and soon my daughter, sixteen years of age, vomited all her dinner.
Then my wife began to feel the effects, and took hot water freely,
sweet oil, currant wine, and at last an overdose of tartar-emetic. Of
course, she was the sickest of all. I was cool and happy and amused at
the situation, and drunk from my head down. I did not vomit, and my
mushrooms remained with me for at least 48 hours. I took nothing but
hot water and sweet oil. A friend of my daughter's of her own age partook
of the mess and had not a single bad symptom."</p>

<p>A physician from West Grove, Pennsylvania, writes: "I determined to
risk a test of the Amanita muscaria. Accordingly, two good-sized specimens
were steamed in butter. I ate one, and another member of my
family ate the other, feeling that the consequences could not be serious
from so small an amount. About an hour after eating, a sensation of
nausea and faintness was experienced in both cases, followed by nervous
tingling, some cold perspiration and accelerated and weakened action of
the heart. Considerable prostration ensued within two hours. Knowing
that sulphate of atropin has proved the most successful remedy for the
active principle of the Fly agaric, Amanita muscaria, a small dose, one-sixtieth
of a grain, was taken by each. Considerable relief was experienced
within 30 minutes, and all unpleasant symptoms had disappeared within 6
hours, without repeating the medicine."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5-21" id="Page_5-21">[Pg 5-21]</a></span></p><p>Another case, wherein the antagonism of atropin for muscarin was
demonstrated, was brought to our notice during the month of September
of the past year. An entire party of people were badly poisoned by eating
mushrooms, and, although a doctor was called in very late, most of
them were saved by the use of sulphate of atropin.</p>

<p>It would seem from the foregoing cases that the intensity and action of
the mushroom poison must depend in some degree on the constitution of
the individual, as well as on the quality and quantity of the mushrooms
eaten. The first treatment should be to get rid of the poison immediately
and by every possible means, so as to prevent or at least arrest the progress
of inflammation of the alimentary canal, and at the same time to prevent
the absorption of the poison. In a majority of cases the recovery
of the victim depends solely upon the promptness with which vomiting
is excited. Vertigo, convulsions, spasms, and other grave nervous symptoms,
which ordinarily follow the cessation of the most important functions,
yield, ordinarily, to the action of an emetic without the necessity of
ulterior remedies, if taken in time, while the substance is yet in the stomach;
when it has entered the lower bowels purgation is necessary. Sweet
oil should always be taken in combination with castor oil, or such other
purgatives as are used. Enemas of cassia, senna, and sulphate of magnesia
have also been used with good effect.</p>

<p>The fatal poisoning of Count Achilles de Vecchj, in November, 1897, by
eating the Amanita muscaria, is so fresh in the public recollection, and the
details in regard to it were so widely published through the newspaper
press, that it is unnecessary to take up space in recapitulating the circumstances.</p>

<p>The death of Chung Yu Ting, in 1894, was occasioned by eating mushrooms
which he had collected in a patch of woods near Washington, D.
C., and which I identified at the time as Amanita phalloides, sometimes
called the "Death Cup." He had eaten very freely of this mushroom and
died after great suffering, although ten hours had elapsed before the toxic
effects began to show themselves.</p>

<p>Since it has been shown that vinegar and the solution of common salt
have the power to dissolve the alkaloids of the poisonous mushrooms, it
follows that the liquor thus formed must be extremely injurious. It should,
therefore, be obvious that vinegar and salt should not be introduced into
the stomach after poisonous mushrooms have been eaten. The result
would only be to hasten death. Ether and volatile alkali are also attended
with danger. A physician should in all cases be promptly called, and, if
muscarin poisoning is suspected, hypodermic injections of the sulphate
of atropin, the only chemical antidote known to be efficacious, should be
administered, the dose being from <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>180</sub></span> up to <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>35</sub></span> of a grain. Small doses
of atropin can also be taken internally, to accelerate heart action. To
relieve the pains and irritation in the abdomen sweet oil and mucilaginous
drinks should be given.</p>

<div class="likeheading1"><a name="Transcriber"></a>Transcriber's Notes.</div>

<p>To avoid confusion, corrections noted above were not made to the plates or
their captions.</p>

<p>"Membranaceous," "membraneous" and "membranous" all appear multiple times;
I left them as is. Similarly for
"Hynesboro" and "Hynesbury,"
"sebaceus" and "sebæceus,"
"subglobose" and "sub-globose,"
"center" and "centre,"
"network" and "net-work."</p>

<p>Both "Huseman" and "Husemann" appear; perhaps they refer to the same person,
but I couldn't be sure, so I left them as is.</p>

<p>There is little consistency about when names are italicized or placed in quotes.
Except where noted below, I left them as typeset in the original.</p>

<p>Changed "filamentose" to "filamentous" on page 7 of part 1:
